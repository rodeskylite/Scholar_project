"Landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning algorithms and comparison of their performance at Abha Basin, Asir Region, Saudi Arabia","Ahmed M. Youssef, Hamid Reza Pourghasemi",2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.05.010,https://openalex.org/W3036091573,"The current study aimed at evaluating the capabilities of seven advanced machine learning techniques (MLTs), including, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes (NB), for landslide susceptibility modeling and comparison of their performances. Coupling machine learning algorithms with spatial data types for landslide susceptibility mapping is a vitally important issue. This study was carried out using GIS and R open source software at Abha Basin, Asir Region, Saudi Arabia. First, a total of 243 landslide locations were identified at Abha Basin to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data sources. All the landslide areas were randomly separated into two groups with a ratio of 70% for training and 30% for validating purposes. Twelve landslide-variables were generated for landslide susceptibility modeling, which include altitude, lithology, distance to faults, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse/landcover (LULC), distance to roads, slope angle, distance to streams, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope length (LS), and slope-aspect. The area under curve (AUC-ROC) approach has been applied to evaluate, validate, and compare the MLTs performance. The results indicated that AUC values for seven MLTs range from 89.0% for QDA to 95.1% for RF. Our findings showed that the RF (AUC ​= ​95.1%) and LDA (AUC ​= ​941.7%) have produced the best performances in comparison to other MLTs. The outcome of this study and the landslide susceptibility maps would be useful for environmental protection."
Landslide identification using machine learning,"Haojie Wang, Limin Zhang, K.S. Yin, Hongyu Luo, Jinhui Li",2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.02.012,https://openalex.org/W3010757542,"Landslide identification is critical for risk assessment and mitigation. This paper proposes a novel machine-learning and deep-learning method to identify natural-terrain landslides using integrated geodatabases. First, landslide-related data are compiled, including topographic data, geological data and rainfall-related data. Then, three integrated geodatabases are established; namely, Recent Landslide Database (RecLD), Relict Landslide Database (RelLD) and Joint Landslide Database (JLD). After that, five machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosting methods and convolutional neural network (CNN), are utilized and evaluated on each database. A case study in Lantau, Hong Kong, is conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. From the results of the case study, CNN achieves an identification accuracy of 92.5% on RecLD, and outperforms other algorithms due to its strengths in feature extraction and multi dimensional data processing. Boosting methods come second in terms of accuracy, followed by RF, LR and SVM. By using machine learning and deep learning techniques, the proposed landslide identification method shows outstanding robustness and great potential in tackling the landslide identification problem."
Deep learning-based landslide susceptibility mapping,"Mohammad Azarafza, Mehdi Azarafza, Haluk Akgün, Peter M. Atkinson, Reza Derakhshani",2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-03585-1,https://openalex.org/W4200108305,"Landslides are considered as one of the most devastating natural hazards in Iran, causing extensive damage and loss of life. Landslide susceptibility maps for landslide prone areas can be used to plan for and mitigate the consequences of catastrophic landsliding events. Here, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN-DNN) for mapping landslide susceptibility, and evaluated it on the Isfahan province, Iran, which has not previously been assessed on such a scale. The proposed model was trained and validated using training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets, each containing relevant data on historical landslides, field records and remote sensing images, and a range of geomorphological, geological, environmental and human activity factors as covariates. The CNN-DNN model prediction accuracy was tested using a wide range of statistics from the confusion matrix and error indices from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The CNN-DNN model was evaluated comprehensively by comparing it to several state-of-the-art benchmark machine learning techniques including the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bernoulli Naïve Bayes (BNB) and decision tree (DT) classifiers. The CNN-DNN model for landslide susceptibility mapping was found to predict more accurately than the benchmark algorithms, with an AUC = 90.9%, IRs = 84.8%, MSE = 0.17, RMSE = 0.40, and MAPE = 0.42. The map provided by the CNN-DNN clearly revealed a high-susceptibility area in the west and southwest, related to the main Zagros trend in the province. These findings can be of great utility for landslide risk management and land use planning in the Isfahan province."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Based on Remote Sensing Images and GIS: Comparisons of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Models,"Zhilu Chang, Zhen Du, Fan Zhang, Faming Huang, Jiawu Chen, Wenbin Li, Zizheng Guo",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030502,https://openalex.org/W3004932743,"Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) has been widely and effectively implemented by machine learning (ML) models based on remote sensing (RS) images and Geographic Information System (GIS). However, comparisons of the applications of ML models for LSP from the perspectives of supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (USML) have not been explored. Hence, this study aims to compare the LSP performance of these SML and USML models, thus further to explore the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models and to realize a more accurate and reliable LSP result. Two representative SML models (support vector machine (SVM) and CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)) and two representative USML models (K-means and Kohonen models) are respectively used to scientifically predict the landslide susceptibility indexes, and then these prediction results are discussed. Ningdu County with 446 recorded landslides obtained through field investigations is introduced as case study. A total of 12 conditioning factors are obtained through procession of Landsat TM 8 images and high-resolution aerial images, topographical and hydrological spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in GIS software, and government reports. The area value under the curve of receiver operating features (AUC) is applied for evaluating the prediction accuracy of SML models, and the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy is then introduced to compare the remarkable prediction performance differences between SML and USML models. Overall, the receiver operation curve (ROC) results show that the AUC of the SVM is 0.892 and is slightly greater than the AUC of the CHAID model (0.872). The FR accuracy results show that the SVM model has the highest accuracy for LSP (77.80%), followed by the CHAID model (74.50%), the Kohonen model (72.8%) and the K-means model (69.7%), which indicates that the SML models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the USML models. It can be concluded that selecting recorded landslides as prior knowledge to train and test the LSP models is the key reason for the higher prediction accuracy of the SML models, while the lack of a priori knowledge and target guidance is an important reason for the low LSP accuracy of the USML models. Nevertheless, the USML models can also be used to implement LSP due to their advantages of efficient modeling processes, dimensionality reduction and strong scalability."
Review on remote sensing methods for landslide detection using machine and deep learning,"Amrita Mohan, Amit Kumar Singh, Basant Kumar, R. S. Dwivedi",2020,https://doi.org/10.1002/ett.3998,https://openalex.org/W3037891846,"Abstract Landslide, one of the most critical natural hazards, is caused due to specific compositional slope movement. In the past decades, due to inflation of urbanized area and climate change, a compelling expansion in landslide prevalence took place which is also termed as mass/slope movement and mass wasting, causing extensive collapse around the world. The principal reason for its pursuance is a reduction in the internal resistance of soil and rocks, classified as a slide, topple, fall, and flow. Slopes can be differentiated based on earth material and the nature of its movements. The downward flow of landslides occurs due to excessive rainfall, snowmelt, earthquake, volcanic eruption, and so on. This review article revisits the conventional approaches for identification of landslides, predicting future risk, associated with slope failures, followed by emphasizing the advantages of modern geospatial techniques such as aerial photogrammetry, satellite remote sensing images (ie, panchromatic, multispectral, radar images), Terrestrial laser scanning, and High‐Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HR‐DEM) in updating landslide inventory maps. Machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine, Artificial neural network, deep learning has been extensively used with geographical data producing effective results for assessment of natural hazard/resources and environmental research. Based on recent studies, deep learning is a reliable tool addressing remote sensing challenges such as trade‐off in imaging system producing poor quality investigation, in addition, to expedite consequent task such as image recognition, object detection, classification, and so on. Conventional methods, like pixel and object‐based machine learning methods, have been broadly explored. Advanced development in deep learning technique like CNN (Convolutional neural network) has been extensively successful in information extraction from an image and has exceeded other traditional approaches. Over the past few years, minor attempts have been made for landslide susceptibility mapping using CNN. In addition, small sample sizes for training purpose will be major drawback and notably remarkable while using deep learning techniques. Also, assessment of the model's performance with diverse training and testing proportion other than commonly utilized ratio, that is, 70/30 needs to be explored further. The review article briefly highlights the remote sensing methods for landslide detection using machine learning and deep learning."

As a result, many scientists study the phenomenon, and some of them have focused on producing landslide susceptibility maps that can be used by land-use managers to reduce injury and damage. This paper contributes to this effort by comparing the power and effectiveness of five machine learning, benchmark algorithms—Logistic Model Tree, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine—in creating a reliable shallow landslide susceptibility map for Bijar City in Kurdistan province, Iran. Twenty conditioning factors were applied to 111 shallow landslides and tested using the One-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique for modeling and validation processes. The performance of the models was assessed by statistical-based indexes including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results indicate that all the five machine learning models performed well for shallow landslide susceptibility assessment, but the Logistic Model Tree model (AUC = 0.932) had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, followed by the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.932), Naïve Bayes Tree (AUC = 0.864), ANN (AUC = 0.860), and Support Vector Machine (AUC = 0.834) models. Therefore, we recommend the use of the Logistic Model Tree model in shallow landslide mapping programs in semi-arid regions to help decision makers, planners, land-use managers, and government agencies mitigate the hazard and risk."
A comparative study of heterogeneous ensemble-learning techniques for landslide susceptibility mapping,"Zhice Fang, Yi Wang, Ling Peng, Haoyuan Hong",2020,https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2020.1808897,https://openalex.org/W3087192809,"This study introduces four heterogeneous ensemble-learning techniques, that is, stacking, blending, simple averaging, and weighted averaging, to predict landslide susceptibility in Yanshan County, China. These techniques combine several state-of-the-art classifiers of convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, support vector machine, and logistic regression in specific ways to produce reliable results and avoid problems with the model selection. The study consists of three main steps. The first step establishes a spatial database consisting of 16 landslide conditioning factors and 380 historical landslide locations. The second step randomly selects training (70% of the total) and test (30%) datasets out of grid cells corresponding to landslide and non-slide locations in the study area. The final step constructs the proposed heterogeneous ensemble-learning methods for landslide susceptibility mapping. The proposed ensemble-learning methods show higher prediction accuracy than the individual classifiers mentioned above based on statistical measures. The blending ensemble-learning method achieves the highest overall accuracy of 80.70% compared to the other ensemble-learning methods."
Mapping Landslides on EO Data: Performance of Deep Learning Models vs. Traditional Machine Learning Models,"Nikhil Prakash, Andrea Manconi, Simon Loew",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030346,https://openalex.org/W3001525167,"Mapping landslides using automated methods is a challenging task, which is still largely done using human efforts. Today, the availability of high-resolution EO data products is increasing exponentially, and one of the targets is to exploit this data source for the rapid generation of landslide inventory. Conventional methods like pixel-based and object-based machine learning strategies have been studied extensively in the last decade. In addition, recent advances in CNN (convolutional neural network), a type of deep-learning method, has been widely successful in extracting information from images and have outperformed other conventional learning methods. In the last few years, there have been only a few attempts to adapt CNN for landslide mapping. In this study, we introduce a modified U-Net model for semantic segmentation of landslides at a regional scale from EO data using ResNet34 blocks for feature extraction. We also compare this with conventional pixel-based and object-based methods. The experiment was done in Douglas County, a study area selected in the south of Portland in Oregon, USA, and landslide inventory extracted from SLIDO (Statewide Landslide Information Database of Oregon) was considered as the ground truth. Landslide mapping is an imbalanced learning problem with very limited availability of training data. Our network was trained on a combination of focal Tversky loss and cross-entropy loss functions using augmented image tiles sampled from a selected training area. The deep-learning method was observed to have a better performance than the conventional methods with an MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) score of 0.495 and a POD (probability of detection) rate of 0.72 ."
Landslide susceptibility zonation method based on C5.0 decision tree and K-means cluster algorithms to improve the efficiency of risk management,"Zizheng Guo, Yu Shi, Faming Huang, Xuanmei Fan, Jinsong Huang",2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2021.101249,https://openalex.org/W3169157623,"Machine learning algorithms are an important measure with which to perform landslide susceptibility assessments, but most studies use GIS-based classification methods to conduct susceptibility zonation. This study presents a machine learning approach based on the C5.0 decision tree (DT) model and the K-means cluster algorithm to produce a regional landslide susceptibility map. Yanchang County, a typical landslide-prone area located in northwestern China, was taken as the area of interest to introduce the proposed application procedure. A landslide inventory containing 82 landslides was prepared and subsequently randomly partitioned into two subsets: training data (70% landslide pixels) and validation data (30% landslide pixels). Fourteen landslide influencing factors were considered in the input dataset and were used to calculate the landslide occurrence probability based on the C5.0 decision tree model. Susceptibility zonation was implemented according to the cut-off values calculated by the K-means cluster algorithm. The validation results of the model performance analysis showed that the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) of the proposed model was the highest, reaching 0.88, compared with traditional models (support vector machine (SVM) = 0.85, Bayesian network (BN) = 0.81, frequency ratio (FR) = 0.75, weight of evidence (WOE) = 0.76). The landslide frequency ratio and frequency density of the high susceptibility zones were 6.76/km2 and 0.88/km2, respectively, which were much higher than those of the low susceptibility zones. The top 20% interval of landslide occurrence probability contained 89% of the historical landslides but only accounted for 10.3% of the total area. Our results indicate that the distribution of high susceptibility zones was more focused without containing more ""stable"" pixels. Therefore, the obtained susceptibility map is suitable for application to landslide risk management practices."
"Landslide Susceptibility Evaluation and Management Using Different Machine Learning Methods in The Gallicash River Watershed, Iran","Alireza Arabameri, Sunil Saha, Jagabandhu Roy, Wei Chen, Thomas Blaschke, Dieu Tien Bui",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030475,https://openalex.org/W3005376489,"This analysis aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) using various machine learning methods, namely random forest (RF), alternative decision tree (ADTree) and Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Function (FLDA). The results of the FLDA, RF and ADTree models were compared with regard to their applicability for creating an LSM of the Gallicash river watershed in the northern part of Iran close to the Caspian Sea. A landslide inventory map was created using GPS points obtained in a field analysis, high-resolution satellite images, topographic maps and historical records. A total of 249 landslide sites have been identified to date and were used in this study to model and validate the LSMs of the study region. Of the 249 landslide locations, 70% were used as training data and 30% for the validation of the resulting LSMs. Sixteen factors related to topographical, hydrological, soil type, geological and environmental conditions were used and a multi-collinearity test of the landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) was performed. Using the natural break method (NBM) in a geographic information system (GIS), the LSMs generated by the RF, FLDA, and ADTree models were categorized into five classes, namely very low, low, medium, high and very high landslide susceptibility (LS) zones. The very high susceptibility zones cover 15.37% (ADTree), 16.10% (FLDA) and 11.36% (RF) of the total catchment area. The results of the different models (FLDA, RF, and ADTree) were explained and compared using the area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, seed cell area index (SCAI), efficiency and true skill statistic (TSS). The accuracy of models was calculated considering both the training and validation data. The results revealed that the AUROC success rates are 0.89 (ADTree), 0.92 (FLDA) and 0.97 (RF) and predication rates are 0.82 (ADTree), 0.79 (FLDA) and 0.98 (RF), which justifies the approach and indicates a reasonably good landslide prediction. The results of the SCAI, efficiency and TSS methods showed that all models have an excellent modeling capability. In a comparison of the models, the RF model outperforms the boosted regression tree (BRT) and ADTree models. The results of the landslide susceptibility modeling could be useful for land-use planning and decision-makers, for managing and controlling the current and future landslides, as well as for the protection of society and the ecosystem."
"Slope stability prediction using ensemble learning techniques: A case study in Yunyang County, Chongqing, China","Wengang Zhang, Hongrui Li, Liang Han, Longlong Chen, Lin Wang",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2021.12.011,https://openalex.org/W4206280001,"Slope stability prediction plays a significant role in landslide disaster prevention and mitigation. This study develops an ensemble learning-based method to predict the slope stability by introducing the random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). As an illustration, the proposed approach is applied to the stability prediction of 786 landslide cases in Yunyang County, Chongqing, China. For comparison, the predictive performance of RF, XGBoost, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) is systematically investigated based on the well-established confusion matrix, which contains the known indices of recall rate, precision, and accuracy. Furthermore, the feature importance of the 12 influencing variables is also explored. Results show that the accuracy of the XGBoost and RF for both the training and testing data is superior to that of SVM and LR, revealing the superiority of the ensemble learning models (i.e. XGBoost and RF) in the slope stability prediction of Yunyang County. Among the 12 influencing factors, the profile shape is the most important one. The proposed ensemble learning-based method offers a promising way to rationally capture the slope status. It can be extended to the prediction of slope stability of other landslide-prone areas of interest."

Moreover, analyses that are conducted can be strongly biased by the standard models employed by seismologists. In response to both of these challenges, we develop a new unsupervised machine learning framework for detecting and clustering seismic signals in continuous seismic records. Our approach combines a deep scattering network and a Gaussian mixture model to cluster seismic signal segments and detect novel structures. To illustrate the power of the framework, we analyze seismic data acquired during the June 2017 Nuugaatsiaq, Greenland landslide. We demonstrate the blind detection and recovery of the repeating precursory seismicity that was recorded before the main landslide rupture, which suggests that our approach could lead to more informative forecasting of the seismic activity in seismogenic areas."

In the development of the ML models, a total of 11 significant landslide controlling factors were selected. The controlling factors relate to the geomorphology, geology, geo-environment and anthropogenic effects: slope angle, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, flow accumulation, flow direction, distance to rivers, water content, saturation, rainfall and distance to roads. It is observed that slope angle was the most significant controlling factor in the ML analyses. The performance of the three ML models was evaluated quantitatively based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results show that the 'ensemble' GBRT machine learning model yielded the most promising results for the spatial prediction of shallow landslides, with a 95% probability of landslide detection and 87% prediction efficiency."

We created a geographic information system database, and our analysis results were used to prepare a landslide inventory map containing 359 landslide events identified from Google Earth, aerial photographs, and other validated sources. A support vector regression (SVR) machine-learning model was used to divide the landslide inventory into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. The landslide susceptibility map was produced using 14 causative factors. We applied the established gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, bat algorithm (BA), and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) to fine-tune the parameters of the SVR model to improve its predictive accuracy. The resultant hybrid models, SVR-GWO, SVR-BA, and SVR-COA, were validated in terms of the area under curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE). The AUC values for the SVR-GWO (0.733), SVR-BA (0.724), and SVR-COA (0.738) models indicate their good prediction rates for landslide susceptibility modeling. SVR-COA had the greatest accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.21687, and SVR-BA had the least accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.23046. The three optimized hybrid models outperformed the SVR model (AUC = 0.704, RMSE = 0.26689), confirming the ability of metaheuristic algorithms to improve model performance."
Spatial landslide susceptibility assessment using machine learning techniques assisted by additional data created with generative adversarial networks,"Husam A. H. Al-Najjar, Biswajeet Pradhan",2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.09.002,https://openalex.org/W3088698272,"In recent years, landslide susceptibility mapping has substantially improved with advances in machine learning. However, there are still challenges remain in landslide mapping due to the availability of limited inventory data. In this paper, a novel method that improves the performance of machine learning techniques is presented. The proposed method creates synthetic inventory data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for improving the prediction of landslides. In this research, landslide inventory data of 156 landslide locations were identified in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, taken from previous projects the authors worked on. Elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, total curvature, lithology, land use and land cover (LULC), distance to the road, distance to the river, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), terrain roughness index (TRI), topographic wetness index (TWI) and vegetation density are geo-environmental factors considered in this study based on suggestions from previous works on Cameron Highlands. To show the capability of GANs in improving landslide prediction models, this study tests the proposed GAN model with benchmark models namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Bagging ensemble models with ANN and SVM models. These models were validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The DT, RF, SVM, ANN and Bagging ensemble could achieve the AUROC values of (0.90, 0.94, 0.86, 0.69 and 0.82) for the training; and the AUROC of (0.76, 0.81, 0.85, 0.72 and 0.75) for the test, subsequently. When using additional samples, the same models achieved the AUROC values of (0.92, 0.94, 0.88, 0.75 and 0.84) for the training and (0.78, 0.82, 0.82, 0.78 and 0.80) for the test, respectively. Using the additional samples improved the test accuracy of all the models except SVM. As a result, in data-scarce environments, this research showed that utilizing GANs to generate supplementary samples is promising because it can improve the predictive capability of common landslide prediction models."
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: Machine and Ensemble Learning Based on Remote Sensing Big Data,"Bahareh Kalantar, Naonori Ueda, Vahideh Saeidi, Kourosh Ahmadi, Alfian Abdul Halin, Farzin Shabani",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12111737,https://openalex.org/W3030992380,"Predicting landslide occurrences can be difficult. However, failure to do so can be catastrophic, causing unwanted tragedies such as property damage, community displacement, and human casualties. Research into landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) attempts to alleviate such catastrophes through the identification of landslide prone areas. Computational modelling techniques have been successful in related disaster scenarios, which motivate this work to explore such modelling for LSM. In this research, the potential of supervised machine learning and ensemble learning is investigated. Firstly, the Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA) supervised learning algorithm is trained for LSM and compared against other algorithms that have been widely used for the same purpose, namely Generalized Logistic Models (GLM), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT or GBM), and Random Forest (RF). Next, an ensemble model consisting of all four algorithms is implemented to examine possible performance improvements. The dataset used to train and test all the algorithms consists of a landslide inventory map of 227 landslide locations. From these sources, 13 conditioning factors are extracted to be used in the models. Experimental evaluations are made based on True Skill Statistic (TSS), the Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve and kappa index. The results show that the best TSS (0.6986), ROC (0.904) and kappa (0.6915) were obtained by the ensemble model. FDA on its own seems effective at modelling landslide susceptibility from multiple data sources, with performance comparable to GLM. However, it slightly underperforms when compared to GBM (BRT) and RF. RF seems most capable compared to GBM, GLM, and FDA, when dealing with all conditioning factors."

Many studies have been conducted based on commercial software. In this study, we create an open source Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system utilizing OBIA and machine learning. Configured to run in Linux environment, it uses various open source Python packages and modules. This system was tested in 575 km2 area along the Pasang Lhamu Highway, Nepal where large numbers of landslides were triggered by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Comparison with a manual inventory highlighted that this system was able to detect 70% of the landslide area. The speed and efficiency with which this system was able to detect landslides makes it a viable alternative to manual techniques for landslide mapping over large areas, when establishing approximate landslide locations is of prime importance."
"Applying deep learning and benchmark machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility modelling in Rorachu river basin of Sikkim Himalaya, India","Kanu Mandal, Sunil Saha, Sujit Mandal",2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2021.101203,https://openalex.org/W3143009190,"Landslide is considered as one of the most severe threats to human life and property in the hilly areas of the world. The number of landslides and the level of damage across the globe has been increasing over time. Therefore, landslide management is essential to maintain the natural and socio-economic dynamics of the hilly region. Rorachu river basin is one of the most landslide-prone areas of the Sikkim selected for the present study. The prime goal of the study is to prepare landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) using computer-based advanced machine learning techniques and compare the performance of the models. To properly understand the existing spatial relation with the landslide, twenty factors, including triggering and causative factors, were selected. A deep learning algorithm viz. convolutional neural network model (CNN) and three popular machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest model (RF), artificial neural network model (ANN), and bagging model, were employed to prepare the LSMs. Two separate datasets including training and validation were designed by randomly taken landslide and non-landslide points. A ratio of 70:30 was considered for the selection of both training and validation points. Multicollinearity was assessed by tolerance and variance inflation factor, and the role of individual conditioning factors was estimated using information gain ratio. The result reveals that there is no severe multicollinearity among the landslide conditioning factors, and the triggering factor rainfall appeared as the leading cause of the landslide. Based on the final prediction values of each model, LSM was constructed and successfully portioned into five distinct classes, like very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The susceptibility class-wise distribution of landslides shows that more than 90% of the landslide area falls under higher landslide susceptibility grades. The precision of models was examined using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and statistical methods like root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). In both datasets (training and validation), the CNN model achieved the maximum AUC value of 0.903 and 0.939, respectively. The lowest value of RMSE and MAE also reveals the better performance of the CNN model. So, it can be concluded that all the models have performed well, but the CNN model has outperformed the other models in terms of precision."
Landslide detection in the Himalayas using machine learning algorithms and U-Net,"Sansar Raj Meena, Lucas Pedrosa Soares, Carlos Henrique Grohmann, C.J. van Westen, Kushanav Bhuyan, R. P. Singh, Mario Floris, Filippo Catani",2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-022-01861-3,https://openalex.org/W4213060692,"Abstract Event-based landslide inventories are essential sources to broaden our understanding of the causal relationship between triggering events and the occurring landslides. Moreover, detailed inventories are crucial for the succeeding phases of landslide risk studies like susceptibility and hazard assessment. The openly available inventories differ in the quality and completeness levels. Event-based landslide inventories are created based on manual interpretation, and there can be significant differences in the mapping preferences among interpreters. To address this issue, we used two different datasets to analyze the potential of U-Net and machine learning approaches for automated landslide detection in the Himalayas. Dataset-1 is composed of five optical bands from the RapidEye satellite imagery. Dataset-2 is composed of the RapidEye optical data, and ALOS-PALSAR derived topographical data. We used a small dataset consisting of 239 samples acquired from several training zones and one testing zone to evaluate our models’ performance using the fully convolutional U-Net model, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor, and the Random Forest (RF). We created thirty-two different maps to evaluate and understand the implications of different sample patch sizes and their effect on the accuracy of landslide detection in the study area. The results were then compared against the manually interpreted inventory compiled using fieldwork and visual interpretation of the RapidEye satellite image. We used accuracy assessment metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). In the context of the Nepali Himalayas, employing RapidEye images and machine learning models, a viable patch size was investigated. The U-Net model trained with 128 × 128 pixel patch size yields the best MCC results (76.59%) with the dataset-1. The added information from the digital elevation model benefited the overall detection of landslides. However, it does not improve the model’s overall accuracy but helps differentiate human settlement areas and river sand bars. In this study, the U-Net achieved slightly better results than other machine learning approaches. Although it can depend on architecture of the U-Net model and the complexity of the geographical features in the imagery, the U-Net model is still preliminary in the domain of landslide detection. There is very little literature available related to the use of U-Net for landslide detection. This study is one of the first efforts of using U-Net for landslide detection in the Himalayas. Nevertheless, U-Net has the potential to improve further automated landslide detection in the future for varied topographical and geomorphological scenes."

Existing data-driven susceptibility mapping models are not globally applicable due to the high variability of landslide conditioning parameters and the limitations in the availability of up-to-date and accurate data. Among numerous applications, landslide susceptibility maps are essential for site selection and health monitoring of engineering structures, such as dams, for increasing their lifetime and to prevent from disastrous events caused by the damages. In this study, landslide susceptibility mapping performance of XGBoost algorithm was evaluated in a landslide-prone area in the upper basin of Ataturk Dam, which is a prime investment located in the southeast of Turkey. The study area has a size of 2718.7 km2 with an elevation difference of ca. 2000 m and contains 27 lithological units. EU-DEM v1.1 from the Copernicus Programme was used to derive the geomorphological features. High classification accuracy with area under curve value of 0.96 could be obtained from the XGBoost algorithm. According to the results, the main factors controlling the landslides in the study area are the lithology, altitude and topographic wetness index."
Landslide susceptibility prediction using slope unit-based machine learning models considering the heterogeneity of conditioning factors,"Zhilu Chang, Filippo Catani, Faming Huang, Gengzhe Liu, Sansar Raj Meena, Jinsong Huang, Chuangbing Zhou",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2022.07.009,https://openalex.org/W4293246595,"To perform landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP), it is important to select appropriate mapping unit and landslide-related conditioning factors. The efficient and automatic multi-scale segmentation (MSS) method proposed by the authors promotes the application of slope units. However, LSP modeling based on these slope units has not been performed. Moreover, the heterogeneity of conditioning factors in slope units is neglected, leading to incomplete input variables of LSP modeling. In this study, the slope units extracted by the MSS method are used to construct LSP modeling, and the heterogeneity of conditioning factors is represented by the internal variations of conditioning factors within slope unit using the descriptive statistics features of mean, standard deviation and range. Thus, slope units-based machine learning models considering internal variations of conditioning factors (variant slope-machine learning) are proposed. The Chongyi County is selected as the case study and is divided into 53,055 slope units. Fifteen original slope unit-based conditioning factors are expanded to 38 slope unit-based conditioning factors through considering their internal variations. Random forest (RF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) machine learning models are used to construct variant Slope-RF and Slope-MLP models. Meanwhile, the Slope-RF and Slope-MLP models without considering the internal variations of conditioning factors, and conventional grid units-based machine learning (Grid-RF and MLP) models are built for comparisons through the LSP performance assessments. Results show that the variant Slope-machine learning models have higher LSP performances than Slope-machine learning models; LSP results of variant Slope-machine learning models have stronger directivity and practical application than Grid-machine learning models. It is concluded that slope units extracted by MSS method can be appropriate for LSP modeling, and the heterogeneity of conditioning factors within slope units can more comprehensively reflect the relationships between conditioning factors and landslides. The research results have important reference significance for land use and landslide prevention."
"Comparison of Random Forest Model and Frequency Ratio Model for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM) in Yunyang County (Chongqing, China)","Yue Wang, Deliang Sun, Haijia Wen, Hong Zhang, Fengtai Zhang",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124206,https://openalex.org/W3035067366,"To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR) model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters; especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments."

Modeling and validation were done on 111 shallow landslide locations using 20 conditioning factors tested by the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) technique. We assessed model performance with statistically based indexes, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). All four machine learning models that we tested yielded excellent goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, but the RF-RAF ensemble model (AUC = 0.936) outperformed the BA-RAF, RS-RAF (AUC = 0.907), and RAF (AUC = 0.812) models. The results also show that the Random Forest model significantly improved the predictive capability of the RAF-based classifier and, therefore, can be considered as a useful and an effective tool in regional shallow landslide susceptibility mapping."
Comparative analysis of gradient boosting algorithms for landslide susceptibility mapping,Emrehan Kutluğ Şahin,2020,https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.1831623,https://openalex.org/W3092049673,"The aim of the study is to compare four recent gradient boosting algorithms named as Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) for modelling landslide susceptibility (LS). In the first step of the study, the geodatabase including landslide inventory map and landslide conditioning factors was constructed. In the second step, chi-square (CHI) statistic-based feature selection (FS) technique was utilized to compute the importance of the landslide causative factors. In the third step, tree-based ensemble learning algorithms were applied to predict the potential distribution of landslide susceptibility. Also, the prediction performance of ensemble methods was compared to that of Random Forest (RF) ensemble method. Finally, the prediction capabilities of the methods were assessed using overall accuracy (Acc), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), kappa index, root mean square error (RMSE), and F score measures. In order to further evaluation, the McNemar's test was utilized to assess statistical significance in the differences between the four gradient boosting models. The accuracy results indicated that the CatBoost model had the highest prediction capability (Acc= 0.8503 and AUC= 0.8975), followed by the XGBoost (Acc= 0.8336 and AUC= 0.8860), the LightGBM (Acc= 0.8244 and AUC= 0.8796) and the GBM (Acc= 0.8080 and AUC= 0.8685). On the other hand, the estimated accuracy measures considered in this study showed that the RF method had the lowest prediction capability of compared the others. Although the individual performances of the methods were found to be acceptable level, the CatBoost method showed the superior performance compared to others with respect to the AUC and Acc values estimated in this study. The results of the study confirmed that the relatively new ensemble learning techniques were efficient and robust for producing LS maps and furthermore, it is probably that these algorithms will be preferred more often in the future studies due to their robustness."
Improving Spatial Agreement in Machine Learning-Based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping,"Mohammed Sarfaraz Gani Adnan, Md Salman Rahman, Nahian Ahmed, Bayes Ahmed, Md. Fazleh Rabbi, Rashedur M.

Uncertainties in the results of various landslide susceptibility models create challenges in selecting the most suitable method to manage this complex natural phenomenon. This study aimed to propose an approach to reduce uncertainties in landslide prediction, diagnosing spatial agreement in machine learning-based landslide susceptibility maps. It first developed landslide susceptibility maps of Cox’s Bazar district of Bangladesh, applying four machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), featuring hyperparameter optimization of 12 landslide conditioning factors. The results of all the four models yielded very high prediction accuracy, with the area under the curve (AUC) values range between 0.93 to 0.96. The assessment of spatial agreement of landslide predictions showed that the pixel-wise correlation coefficients of landslide probability between various models range from 0.69 to 0.85, indicating the uncertainty in predicted landslides by various models, despite their considerable prediction accuracy. The uncertainty was addressed by establishing a Logistic Regression (LR) model, incorporating the binary landslide inventory data as the dependent variable and the results of the four landslide susceptibility models as independent variables. The outcomes indicated that the RF model had the highest influence in predicting the observed landslide locations, followed by the MLP, SVM, and KNN models. Finally, a combined landslide susceptibility map was developed by integrating the results of the four machine learning-based landslide predictions. The combined map resulted in better spatial agreement (correlation coefficients range between 0.88 and 0.92) and greater prediction accuracy (0.97) compared to the individual models. The modelling approach followed in this study would be useful in minimizing uncertainties of various methods and improving landslide predictions."

The study area is in southwestern Iran. The region has experienced numerous extreme natural events in recent decades. This study models the probabilities of snow avalanches, landslides, wildfires, land subsidence, and floods using machine learning models that include support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and generalized linear model (GLM). Climatic, topographic, geological, social, and morphological factors were the main input variables used. The data were obtained from several sources. The accuracies of GLM, SVM, and functional discriminant analysis (FDA) models indicate that SVM is the most accurate for predicting landslides, land subsidence, and flood hazards in the study area. GLM is the best algorithm for wildfire mapping, and FDA is the most accurate model for predicting snow avalanche risk. The values of AUC (area under curve) for all five hazards using the best models are greater than 0.8, demonstrating that the model’s predictive abilities are acceptable. A machine learning approach can prove to be very useful tool for hazard management and disaster mitigation, particularly for multi-hazard modeling. The predictive maps produce valuable baselines for risk management in the study area, providing evidence to manage future human interaction with hazards."

Reducing the outputs obtained after each modelling analysis is key to present the results for stakeholders, land managers and policymakers. So, the main goal of this survey was to present a method to synthesize three natural hazards in one multi-hazard map and its evaluation for hazard management and land use planning. To test this methodology, we took as study area the Gorganrood Watershed, located in the Golestan Province (Iran). First, an inventory map of three different types of hazards including flood, landslides, and gullies was prepared using field surveys and different official reports. To generate the susceptibility maps, a total of 17 geo-environmental factors were selected as predictors using the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) machine learning technique. The accuracy of the predictive models was evaluated by drawing receiver operating characteristic-ROC curves and calculating the area under the ROC curve-AUCROC. The MaxEnt model not only implemented superbly in the degree of fitting, but also obtained significant results in predictive performance. Variables importance of the three studied types of hazards showed that river density, distance from streams, and elevation were the most important factors for flood, respectively. Lithological units, elevation, and annual mean rainfall were relevant for detecting landslides. On the other hand, annual mean rainfall, elevation, and lithological units were used for gully erosion mapping in this study area. Finally, by combining the flood, landslides, and gully erosion susceptibility maps, an integrated multi-hazard map was created. The results demonstrated that 60% of the area is subjected to hazards, reaching a proportion of landslides up to 21.2% in the whole territory. We conclude that using this type of multi-hazard map may be a useful tool for local administrators to identify areas susceptible to hazards at large scales as we demonstrated in this research."

In this study, a novel interpretable model based on SHAP and XGBoost is proposed to interpret landslides susceptibility evaluation at global and local levels. The established evaluation model provided 0.75 accuracy and 0.83 AUC value for the test sets. The global interpretation shows that the peak rainfall intensity and elevation are the dominant factors that influence the occurrence of landslides in the study area. The combination of local interpretation and field investigations can provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating designated landslides, and it can also be used as a reference for preventing and managing the hazards of landslides."

Originally, most of those maps were generated by the judgements of experts, which is time‐consuming and laborious, and whose accuracy is difficult to be quantified because of the subjective effects. With the development of machine learning algorithms and the methods of data collection, big data and artificial intelligence have now been popularized in this field, significantly improving mapping accuracy and efficiency. Various machine learning‐based methods, mainly including conventional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning have been applied and compared in LSM in different areas by previous researchers. Nevertheless, none of them can be effective in all cases. Although deep learning‐based methods were proven more accurate than conventional machine learning‐based methods in most data‐rich situations, the latter is sometimes more popularly used in LSM, as there is not that much data in this field to train a deep learning network perfectly. In a more rigorous situation when there is very limited data, transfer learning‐based approaches are applied by several researchers, which have contributed to improve the workability and the accuracy of LSM in data‐limited areas. Such technical explosion has promoted the application of landslide susceptibility maps, thus contributing to mitigating the social‐eco impact associated with landslides. This paper comprehensively reviews the whole process of generating landslide susceptibility maps based on machine learning methods, introduces and compares the commonly used machine learning methods, and discusses the topics for future research."

The key objective of this study is to estimate a LS map for the Taleghan-Alamut basin of Iran using Credal Decision Tree (CDT)-based (i.e. CDT-Bagging, CDT-Multiboost and CDT-SubSpace) hybrid machine learning approaches, which are state-of-the-art soft computing approaches that are hardly ever utilized in the assessment of LS. In this study, we used eighteen landslide predisposing factors (LPFs) that we considered to be the most important local morphological and geo-environmental factors influencing the occurrence of landslides. We calculated the significance of each of the LPFs in the landslide susceptibility assessment using the Random Forest Method. We also employed the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, precision, performance, map robustness measurement and selection of the best-fitting models. The results shows that, compared to the other models, the CDT-Multiboost is the excellent model in this perspective with an average area under curve (AUC) of 0.993 based on a 4-fold cross-validation. We, therefore, consider the CDT-Multiboost models to be an effective method for improving spatial prediction of LS where landslide scarps or bodies are not clearly identified during the preparation of landslide inventory maps. Therefore, it will be helpful for preparing future landslide inventory maps and mitigate landslide damages."

To better understand this global hazard, the Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model was developed previously. LHASA version 1 combines satellite precipitation estimates with a global landslide susceptibility map to produce a gridded map of potentially hazardous areas from 60° North-South every 3 h. LHASA version 1 categorizes the world’s land surface into three ratings: high, moderate, and low hazard with a single decision tree that first determines if the last seven days of rainfall were intense, then evaluates landslide susceptibility. LHASA version 2 has been developed with a data-driven approach. The global susceptibility map was replaced with a collection of explanatory variables, and two new dynamically varying quantities were added: snow and soil moisture. Along with antecedent rainfall, these variables modulated the response to current daily rainfall. In addition, the Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was supplemented with several inventories of rainfall-triggered landslide events. These factors were incorporated into the machine-learning framework XGBoost, which was trained to predict the presence or absence of landslides over the period 2015–2018, with the years 2019–2020 reserved for model evaluation. As a result of these improvements, the new global landslide nowcast was twice as likely to predict the occurrence of historical landslides as LHASA version 1, given the same global false positive rate. Furthermore, the shift to probabilistic outputs allows users to directly manage the trade-off between false negatives and false positives, which should make the nowcast useful for a greater variety of geographic settings and applications. In a retrospective analysis, the trained model ran over a global domain for 5 years, and results for LHASA version 1 and version 2 were compared. Due to the importance of rainfall and faults in LHASA version 2, nowcasts would be issued more frequently in some tropical countries, such as Colombia and Papua New Guinea; at the same time, the new version placed less emphasis on arid regions and areas far from the Pacific Rim. LHASA version 2 provides a nearly real-time view of global landslide hazard for a variety of stakeholders."
A new strategy to map landslides with a generalized convolutional neural network,"Nikhil Prakash, Andrea Manconi, Simon Loew",2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89015-8,https://openalex.org/W3158723639,"Abstract Rapid mapping of event landslides is crucial to identify the areas affected by damages as well as for effective disaster response. Traditionally, such maps are generated with visual interpretation of remote sensing imagery (manned/unmanned airborne systems or spaceborne sensors) and/or using pixel-based and object-based methods exploiting data-intensive machine learning algorithms. Recent works have explored the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning algorithm, for mapping landslides from remote sensing data. These methods follow a standard supervised learning workflow that involves training a model using a landslide inventory covering a relatively small area. The trained model is then used to predict landslides in the surrounding regions. Here, we propose a new strategy, i.e., a progressive CNN training relying on combined inventories to build a generalized model that can be applied directly to a new, unexplored area. We first prove the effectiveness of CNNs by training and validating on event landslides inventories in four regions after earthquakes and/or extreme meteorological events. Next, we use the trained CNNs to map landslides triggered by new events spread across different geographic regions. We found that CNNs trained on a combination of inventories have a better generalization performance, with a bias towards high precision and low recall scores. In our tests, the combined training model achieved the highest (Matthews correlation coefficient) MCC score of 0.69 when mapping landslides in new unseen regions. The mapping was done on images from different optical sensors, resampled to a spatial resolution of 6 m, 10 m, and 30 m. Despite a slightly reduced performance, the main advantage of combined training is to overcome the requirement of a local inventory for training a new deep learning model. This implementation can facilitate automated pipelines providing fast response for the generation of landslide maps in the post-disaster phase. In this study, the study areas were selected from seismically active zones with a high hydrological hazard distribution and vegetation coverage. Hence, future works should also include regions from less vegetated geographic locations."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Modeling Based on Remote Sensing and a Novel Deep Learning Algorithm of a Cascade-Parallel Recurrent Neural Network,"Li Zhu, Liang-Hao Huang, Linyu Fan, Jinsong Huang, Faming Huang, Jiawu Chen, Zihe Zhang, Yuhao Wang",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20061576,https://openalex.org/W3010924259,"Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) modeling is an important and challenging problem. Landslide features are generally uncorrelated or nonlinearly correlated, resulting in limited LSP performance when leveraging conventional machine learning models. In this study, a deep-learning-based model using the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and conditional random field (CRF) in cascade-parallel form was proposed for making LSPs based on remote sensing (RS) images and a geographic information system (GIS). The RS images are the main data sources of landslide-related environmental factors, and a GIS is used to analyze, store, and display spatial big data. The cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF consists of frequency ratio values of environmental factors in the input layers, cascade-parallel LSTM for feature extraction in the hidden layers, and cascade-parallel full connection for classification and CRF for landslide/non-landslide state modeling in the output layers. The cascade-parallel form of LSTM can extract features from different layers and merge them into concrete features. The CRF is used to calculate the energy relationship between two grid points, and the extracted features are further smoothed and optimized. As a case study, the cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF was applied to Shicheng County of Jiangxi Province in China. A total of 2709 landslide grid cells were recorded and 2709 non-landslide grid cells were randomly selected from the study area. The results show that, compared with existing main traditional machine learning algorithms, such as multilayer perception, logistic regression, and decision tree, the proposed cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF had a higher landslide prediction rate (positive predictive rate: 72.44%, negative predictive rate: 80%, total predictive rate: 75.67%). In conclusion, the proposed cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF is a novel data-driven deep learning model that overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning algorithms and achieves promising results for making LSPs."
A comprehensive comparison among metaheuristics (MHs) for geohazard modeling using machine learning: Insights from a case study of landslide displacement prediction,"Junwei Ma, Ding Xia, Yankun Wang, Xiaoxu Niu, Sheng Jiang, Zhiyang Liu, Haixiang Guo",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105150,https://openalex.org/W4284671606,"Machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to model geohazards, yielding tremendous success. However, researchers and practitioners still face challenges in enhancing the reliability of ML models. In the present study, a systematic framework combining k-fold cross-validation (CV), metaheuristics (MHs), support vector regression (SVR), and Friedman and Nemenyi tests was proposed to improve the reliability and performance of geohazard modeling. The average normalized mean square error (NMSE) from k-fold CV sets was adopted as the fitness metric. Twenty of the most well-established MHs and the most recent MHs were adopted to tune the hyperparameters of SVR and were evaluated through nonparametric Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests to identify significant differences. Observations from a typical reservoir landslide were selected as a benchmark dataset, and the accuracy, robustness, computational time, and convergence speed of the MHs were compared. Significant performance differences among the twenty MHs were identified by Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests of the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), and computational time, with p values lower than 0.05. The comparison of results demonstrated that the multiverse optimizer (MVO) is among the highest-performing, most stable, and computationally efficient algorithms, providing superior performance to other methods, with nearly optimum values of the correlation coefficient (R), a low MAE (23.5086 versus 23.9360), a low mean RMSE (48.6946 versus 50.1882), and a high mean KGE (0.9803 versus 0.9893) in predicting the displacement of the Shuping landslide. This paper considerably enriches the literature regarding hyperparameter optimization algorithms and the enhancement of their reliability. In addition, Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests have the potential for evaluating and comparing various ML-based geohazard models."
Landslide detection by deep learning of non-nadiral and crowdsourced optical images,Filippo Catani,2020,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-020-01513-4,https://openalex.org/W3082129780,"Abstract The recent development of mobile surveying platforms and crowdsourced geoinformation has produced a huge amount of non-validated data that are now available for research and application. In the field of risk analysis, with particular reference to landslide hazard, images generated by autonomous platforms (such as UAVs, ground-based acquisition systems, satellite sensors) and pictures obtained from web data mining are easily gathered and contribute to the fast surge in the amount of non-organized information that may engulf data storage facilities. Therefore, the high potential impact of such methods is severely reduced by the need of a massive amount of human intelligence tasks (HITs), which is necessary to filter and classify the data, whatever the final purpose. In this work, we present a new set of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) specifically designed for the automated recognition of landslides and mass movements in non-standard pictures that can be used in automated image classification, in supporting UAV autonomous guidance and in the filtering of data-mined information. Computer vision can be of great help in fostering the autonomous capability of intelligent systems to complement, or completely substitute, HITs. Image and object recognition are at the forefront of this research field. The deep learning procedure has been accomplished by applying transfer learning to some of the top-performer CNNs available in the literature. Results show that the deep learning machines, calibrated on a relevant dataset of validated images of landforms, may supply reliable predictions with computational time and resource requirements compatible with most of the UAV platforms and web data mining applications in landslide hazard studies. Average accuracy achieved by the proposed methods ranges between 87 and 90% and is consistently higher than that obtained by general-purpose state-of-the-art image recognition convolutional neural networks. The method can be applied to early warning, vulnerability assessment, residual risk estimation, model parameterisation and landslide mapping. Specific advantages will be the reduction of the present limitations in the intelligent guidance of landslide mapping drones, the classification of fake news, the validation of post-disaster information and the correct interpretation of an impending change in the environment."

Data of 167 past and present landslides and various landslide conditioning factors were used for generation of the datasets. The results showed that the RSSFT model achieved the highest performance in terms of Fgiurepredicting future landslides, followed by RSSREPT, RSSBFT, RSSJ48, and RSSNBT, respectively. Therefore, the RSSFT model was found to be more robust model than the other studied models, which can be used in other areas of landslide susceptibility mapping for proper landuse planning and management."

Direct or indirect effects can be related to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, floods, landslides, etc. As such a significant process, timely and continuous monitoring of forest dynamics is important, to constantly follow existing policies and develop new mitigation measures. The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the Pará state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of high-resolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000–2006; for the period 2006–2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019–2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies."
Metaheuristic-based support vector regression for landslide displacement prediction: a comparative study,"Junwei Ma, Ding Xia, Haixiang Guo, Yankun Wang, Xiaoxu Niu, Zhiyang Liu, Sheng Jiang",2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-022-01923-6,https://openalex.org/W4283750094,"Abstract Recently, integrated machine learning (ML) metaheuristic algorithms, such as the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and water cycle algorithm (WCA), have become predominant approaches for landslide displacement prediction. However, these algorithms suffer from poor reproducibility across replicate cases. In this study, a hybrid approach integrating k-fold cross validation (CV), metaheuristic support vector regression (SVR), and the nonparametric Friedman test is proposed to enhance reproducibility. The five previously mentioned metaheuristics were compared in terms of accuracy, computational time, robustness, and convergence. The results obtained for the Shuping and Baishuihe landslides demonstrate that the hybrid approach can be utilized to determine the optimum hyperparameters and present statistical significance, thus enhancing accuracy and reliability in ML-based prediction. Significant differences were observed among the five metaheuristics. Based on the Friedman test, which was performed on the root mean square error (RMSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and computational time, PSO is recommended for hyperparameter tuning for SVR-based displacement prediction due to its ability to maintain a balance between precision, computational time, and robustness. The nonparametric Friedman test is promising for presenting statistical significance, thus enhancing reproducibility."

The choice of conditional factors is crucial to the results of LSM, and the selection of models also plays an important role. In this study, a hybrid method including GeoDetector and machine learning cluster was developed to provide a new perspective on how to address these two issues. We defined redundant factors by quantitatively analyzing the single impact and interactive impact of the factors, which was analyzed by GeoDetector, the effect of this step was examined using mean absolute error (MAE). The machine learning cluster contains four models (artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian network (BN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM)) and automatically selects the best one for generating LSM. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, prediction accuracy, and the seed cell area index (SCAI) methods were used to evaluate these methods. The results show that the SVM model had the best performance in the machine learning cluster with the area under the ROC curve of 0.928 and with an accuracy of 83.86%. Therefore, SVM was chosen as the assessment model to map the landslide susceptibility of the study area. The landslide susceptibility map demonstrated fit with landslide inventory, indicated the hybrid method is effective in screening landslide influences and assessing landslide susceptibility."

The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH."
Prediction of landslide displacement with dynamic features using intelligent approaches,"Yonggang Zhang, Jun Tang, Yung‐Ming Cheng, Lei Huang, Fei Guo, Xiangjie Yin, Na Li",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmst.2022.02.004,https://openalex.org/W4213192855,"Landslide displacement prediction can enhance the efficacy of landslide monitoring system, and the prediction of the periodic displacement is particularly challenging. In the previous studies, static regression models (e.g., support vector machine (SVM)) were mostly used for predicting the periodic displacement. These models may have bad performances, when the dynamic features of landslide triggers are incorporated. This paper proposes a method for predicting the landslide displacement in a dynamic manner, based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network and complete ensemble empirical decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). The CEEMDAN is used to decompose the training data, and the GRU is subsequently used for predicting the periodic displacement. Implementation procedures of the proposed method were illustrated by a case study in the Caojiatuo landslide area, and SVM was also adopted for the periodic displacement prediction. This case study shows that the predictors obtained by SVM are inaccurate, as the landslide displacement is in a pronouncedly step-wise manner. By contrast, the accuracy can be significantly improved using the dynamic predictive method. This paper reveals the significance of capturing the dynamic features of the inputs in the training process, when the machine learning models are adopted to predict the landslide displacement."

Genetic algorithms (GA) are used as a feature selection method, whereas the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used to optimize the structural parameters of two ML models, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). A well-defined spatial database, which included 335 landslides and twelve landslide-related variables (elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, distance to faults, distance to river, lithology, and hydrological cover) are considered for the analysis, in the Achaia Regional Unit located in Northern Peloponnese, Greece. The outcome of the study illustrates that both ML models have an excellent performance, with the SVM model achieving the highest learning accuracy (0.977 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value (AUC)), followed by the ANN model (0.969). However, the ANN model shows the highest prediction accuracy (0.800 AUC), followed by the SVM (0.750 AUC) model. Overall, the proposed ML models highlights the necessity of feature selection and tuning procedures via evolutionary optimization algorithms and that such approaches could be successfully used for landslide susceptibility mapping as an alternative investigation tool."

We located 152 landslides using a combination of interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Google Earth (GE), and field surveys. Of the total slide locations, 80% (122 landslides) were utilized for training the selected algorithms, and the remaining 20% (30 landslides) were applied for validation purposes. We employed 17 conditioning factors, including slope angle, aspect, elevation, curvature, profile curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, soil type, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to river, distance to fault, distance to road, river density, fault density, and road density, which were produced from satellite imageries, geological map, soil maps, and a digital elevation model (DEM). We used these factors to produce landslide susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), and random forest (RF) models. To assess prediction accuracy of the models we employed the following statistical measures: negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Our results indicated that the AUC was 92%, 90%, and 88% for the LMT, LR, and RF algorithms, respectively. To assess model performance, we also applied non-parametric statistical tests of Friedman and Wilcoxon, where the results revealed that there were no practical differences among the used models in the study area. While landslide mapping in tropical environment such as Cameron Highlands remains difficult, the remote sensing (RS) along with machine learning techniques, such as the LMT model, show promise for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area."
An explainable AI (XAI) model for landslide susceptibility modeling,"Biswajeet Pradhan, Abhirup Dikshit, Saro Lee, Hyesu Kim",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110324,https://openalex.org/W4366981465,"Landslides are among the most devastating natural hazards, severely impacting human lives and damaging property and infrastructure. Landslide susceptibility maps, which help to identify which regions in a given area are at greater risk of a landslide occurring, are a key tool for effective mitigation. Research in this field has grown immensely, ranging from quantitative to deterministic approaches, with a recent surge in machine learning (ML)-based computational models. The development of ML models, in particular, has undergone a meteoritic rise in the last decade, contributing to the successful development of accurate susceptibility maps. However, despite their success, these models are rarely used by stakeholders owing to their “black box” nature. Hence, it is crucial to explain the results, thus providing greater transparency for the use of such models. To address this gap, the present work introduces the use of an ML-based explainable algorithm, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), for landslide susceptibility modeling. A convolutional neural network model was used conducted in the CheongJu region in South Korea. A total of 519 landslide locations were examined with 16 landslide-affected variables, of which 70% was used for training and 30% for testing, and the model achieved an accuracy of 89%. Further, the comparison was performed using Support Vector Machine mode, which achieved an accuracy of 84%. The SHAP plots showed variations in feature interactions for both landslide and non-landslide locations, thus providing more clarity as to how the model achieves a specific result. The SHAP dependence plots explained the relationship between altitude and slope, showing a negative relationship with altitude and a positive relationship with slope. This is the first use of an explainable ML model in landslide susceptibility modeling, and we argue that future works should include aspects of explainability to open up the possibility of developing a transferable artificial intelligence model."

Fast and accurate mapping of coseismic landslides is important for earthquake disaster emergency rescue and landslide risk analysis. Machine learning methods provide automatic solutions for landslide detection, which are more efficient than manual landslide mapping. Deep learning technologies are attracting increasing interest in automatic landslide detection. CNN is one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks for landslide detection. However, in practice, the performance of the existing CNN-based landslide detection models is still far from practical application. Recently, Transformer has achieved better performance in many computer vision tasks, which provides a great opportunity for improving the accuracy of landslide detection. To fill this gap, we explore whether Transformer can outperform CNNs in the landslide detection task. Specifically, we build a new dataset for identifying coseismic landslides. The Transformer-based semantic segmentation model SegFormer is employed to identify coseismic landslides. SegFormer leverages Transformer to obtain a large receptive field, which is much larger than CNN. SegFormer introduces overlapped patch embedding to capture the interaction of adjacent image patches. SegFormer also introduces a simple MLP decoder and sequence reduction to improve its efficiency. The semantic segmentation results of SegFormer are further improved by leveraging image processing operations to distinguish different landslide instances and remove invalid holes. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare Transformer-based model SegFormer with other popular CNN-based models, including HRNet, DeepLabV3, Attention-UNet, U2Net and FastSCNN. SegFormer improves the accuracy, mIoU, IoU and F1 score of landslide detectuin by 2.2%, 5% and 3%, respectively. SegFormer also reduces the pixel-wise classification error rate by 14%. Both quantitative evaluation and visualization results show that Transformer is capable of outperforming CNNs in landslide detection."

To construct and verify the hybrid RFM model, a shallow landslide database of the Lang Son area (northern Vietnam) was prepared. The database consisted of 101 shallow landslide polygons and 14 conditioning factors. The relevance of these factors for shallow landslide susceptibility modeling was assessed using the ReliefF method. Experimental results pointed out that the proposed RFM can help to achieve the desired prediction with an F1 score of roughly 0.96. The performance of the RFM was better than those of benchmark approaches, including the SVM, RFC, and logistic regression. Thus, the newly developed RFM is a promising tool to help local authorities in shallow landslide hazard mitigations."

An effective multi-hazard risk mitigation strategy includes assessing individual hazards as well as their interactions. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, multi-hazard susceptibility prediction techniques based on machine learning has encountered a huge bottleneck. In order to effectively solve this problem, this study proposes a multi-hazard susceptibility mapping framework using the classical deep learning algorithm of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). First, we use historical flash flood, debris flow and landslide locations based on Google Earth images, extensive field surveys, topography, hydrology, and environmental data sets to train and validate the proposed CNN method. Next, the proposed CNN method is assessed in comparison to conventional logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor methods using several objective criteria, i.e., coefficient of determination, overall accuracy, mean absolute error and the root mean square error. Experimental results show that the CNN method outperforms the conventional machine learning algorithms in predicting probability of flash floods, debris flows and landslides. Finally, the susceptibility maps of the three hazards based on CNN are combined to create a multi-hazard susceptibility map. It can be observed from the map that 62.43% of the study area are prone to hazards, while 37.57% of the study area are harmless. In hazard-prone areas, 16.14%, 4.94% and 30.66% of the study area are susceptible to flash floods, debris flows and landslides, respectively. In terms of concurrent hazards, 0.28%, 7.11% and 3.13% of the study area are susceptible to the joint occurrence of flash floods and debris flow, debris flow and landslides, and flash floods and landslides, respectively, whereas, 0.18% of the study area is subject to all the three hazards. The results of this study can benefit engineers, disaster managers and local government officials involved in sustainable land management and disaster risk mitigation."

The originality of this research is acknowledged by combining together: (a) a recap of important theoretical aspects of DdLSM; (b) a bibliometric analysis on the topic; (c) a quantitative-oriented review of relevant publications; and (d) a systematic summary of the findings, indicating important aspects and potential developments related to the DdLSM research topic. The results show that DdLSM are used within a wide range of applications with study area extents ranging from a few kilometers to national and even continental scales. In more than 70% of publications, a combination of the predictors, slope angle, aspect and geology are used. Simple classifiers, such as, logistic regression or approaches based on frequency ratio are still popular, despite the upcoming trend of applying machine learning algorithms. When analyzing validation techniques, 38% of the publications were not clear about the validation method used. Within the studies that included validation techniques, the AUROC was the most popular validation metric, being used accounting for 44% of the studies. Finally, it can be concluded that the application of new classification techniques is often cited as a main research scope, even though the most relevant innovation could also lie in tackling data-quality issues and research designs adaptations to fit the input data particularities in order to improve prediction quality."
Ensemble learning framework for landslide susceptibility mapping: Different basic classifier and ensemble strategy,"Taorui Zeng, Liyang Wu, Dario Peduto, Thomas Glade, Yuichi S. Hayakawa, Kunlong Yin",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2023.101645,https://openalex.org/W4379741992,"The application of ensemble learning models has been continuously improved in recent landslide susceptibility research, but most studies have no unified ensemble framework. Moreover, few papers have discussed the applicability of the ensemble learning model in landslide susceptibility mapping at the township level. This study aims at defining a robust ensemble framework that can become the benchmark method for future research dealing with the comparison of different ensemble models. For this purpose, the present work focuses on three different basic classifiers: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron neural network model (MLPNN) and two homogeneous ensemble models such as random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The hierarchical construction of deep ensemble relied on two leading ensemble technologies (i.e., homogeneous/heterogeneous model ensemble and bagging, boosting, stacking ensemble strategy) to provide a more accurate and effective spatial probability of landslide occurrence. The selected study area is Dazhou town, located in the Jurassic red-strata area in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China, which is a strategic economic area currently characterized by widespread landslide risk. Based on a long-term field investigation, the inventory counting thirty-three slow-moving landslide polygons was drawn. The results show that the ensemble models do not necessarily perform better; for instance, the Bagging based DT-SVM-MLPNN-XGBoost model performed worse than the single XGBoost model. Amongst the eleven tested models, the Stacking based RF-XGBoost model, which is a homogeneous model based on bagging, boosting, and stacking ensemble, showed the highest capability of predicting the landslide-affected areas. Besides, the factor behaviors of DT, SVM, MLPNN, RF and XGBoost models reflected the characteristics of slow-moving landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir area, wherein unfavorable lithological conditions and intense human engineering activities (i.e., reservoir water level fluctuation, residential area construction, and farmland development) are proven to be the key triggers. The presented approach could be used for landslide spatial occurrence prediction in similar regions and other fields."

Floods and landslides are widespread and recurring hazards occurring at an alarming rate in recent years. The importance of this study is to produce multi-hazard exposure maps for flooding and landslides for the federal State of Salzburg, Austria, using the selected machine learning (ML) approach of support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Multi-hazard exposure maps were established on thirteen influencing factors for flood and landslides such as elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), geology, lithology, rainfall, land cover, distance to roads, distance to faults, and distance to drainage. We classified the inventory data for flood and landslide into training and validation with the widely used splitting ratio, where 70% of the locations are used for training, and 30% are used for validation. The accuracy assessment of the exposure maps was derived through ROC (receiver operating curve) and R-Index (relative density). RF yielded better results for both flood and landslide exposure with 0.87 for flood and 0.90 for landslides compared to 0.87 for flood and 0.89 for landslides using SVM. However, the multi-hazard exposure map for the State of Salzburg derived through RF and SVM provides the planners and managers to plan better for risk regions affected by both floods and landslides."
Landslide Detection Using Densely Connected Convolutional Networks and Environmental Conditions,"Haojie Cai, Tao Chen, Ruiqing Niu, Antonio Plaza",2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2021.3079196,https://openalex.org/W3163894833,"A complete and accurate landslide map is necessary for landslide susceptibility and risk assessment. Currently, deep learning faces the dilemma of insufficient application, scarce samples, and poor efficiency in landslide recognition. This article utilizes the advantages of dense convolutional networks (DenseNets) and their modified technique to solve the three proposed problems. For this purpose, we created a new landslide sample library. On the original remote sensing image, 12 geological, topographic, hydrological and land cover factors that can directly or indirectly reflect the landslide are superimposed. Then, landslide detection was carried out in the three Gorges reservoir area in China to test the performance of the improved method. The quantitative evaluation of the landslide detection map shows that the combination of environmental factors and DenseNet can improve the accuracy of the detection model. Compared with the optical image, kappa and F1 increased by 9.7% and 9.1% respectively. Compared with other traditional neural networks and machine learning algorithms, DenseNet has the highest kappa and F1 values. Based on the base Densenet, through data augmentation and fine-tuning optimization technology, the kappa and F1 values reach the highest values of 0.9474 and 0.9505, respectively. The proposed method has promising applicability in large area landslide identification scenarios."
Evaluating the Performance of Individual and Novel Ensemble of Machine Learning and Statistical Models for Landslide Susceptibility Assessment at Rudraprayag District of Garhwal Himalaya,"Sunil Saha, Anik Saha, Tusar Kanti Hembram, Biswajeet Pradhan, Abdullah Alamri",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/app10113772,https://openalex.org/W3034020184,"Landslides are known as the world’s most dangerous threat in mountainous regions and pose a critical obstacle for both economic and infrastructural progress. It is, therefore, quite relevant to discuss the pattern of spatial incidence of this phenomenon. The current research manifests a set of individual and ensemble of machine learning and probabilistic approaches like an artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and their ensembles such as ANN-RF, ANN-SVM, SVM-RF, SVM-LR, LR-RF, LR-ANN, ANN-LR-RF, ANN-RF-SVM, ANN-SVM-LR, RF-SVM-LR, and ANN-RF-SVM-LR for mapping landslide susceptibility in Rudraprayag district of Garhwal Himalaya, India. A landslide inventory map along with sixteen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) was used. Randomly partitioned sets of 70%:30% were used to ascertain the goodness of fit and predictive ability of the models. The contribution of LCFs was analyzed using the RF model. The altitude and drainage density were found to be the responsible factors in causing the landslide in the study area according to the RF model. The robustness of models was assessed through three threshold dependent measures, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC), precision and accuracy, and two threshold independent measures, i.e., mean-absolute-error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE). Finally, using the compound factor (CF) method, the models were prioritized based on the results of the validation methods to choose best model. Results show that ANN-RF-LR indicated a realistic finding, concentrating only on 17.74% of the study area as highly susceptible to landslide. The ANN-RF-LR ensemble demonstrated the highest goodness of fit and predictive capacity with respective values of 87.83% (area under the success rate curve) and 93.98% (area under prediction rate curve), and the highest robustness correspondingly. These attempts will play a significant role in ensemble modeling, in building reliable and comprehensive models. The proposed ANN-RF-LR ensemble model may be used in the other geographic areas having similar geo-environmental conditions. It may also be used in other types of geo-hazard modeling."
A Machine Learning-Based Approach for Surface Soil Moisture Estimations with Google Earth Engine,"Felix Greifeneder, Claudia Notarnicola, Wolfgang Wagner",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13112099,https://openalex.org/W3167659500,"Due to its relation to the Earth’s climate and weather and phenomena like drought, flooding, or landslides, knowledge of the soil moisture content is valuable to many scientific and professional users. Remote-sensing offers the unique possibility for continuous measurements of this variable. Especially for agriculture, there is a strong demand for high spatial resolution mapping. However, operationally available soil moisture products exist with medium to coarse spatial resolution only (≥1 km). This study introduces a machine learning (ML)—based approach for the high spatial resolution (50 m) mapping of soil moisture based on the integration of Landsat-8 optical and thermal images, Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR images, and modelled data, executable in the Google Earth Engine. The novelty of this approach lies in applying an entirely data-driven ML concept for global estimation of the surface soil moisture content. Globally distributed in situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network acted as an input for model training. Based on the independent validation dataset, the resulting overall estimation accuracy, in terms of Root-Mean-Squared-Error and R², was 0.04 m3·m−3 and 0.81, respectively. Beyond the retrieval model itself, this article introduces a framework for collecting training data and a stand-alone Python package for soil moisture mapping. The Google Earth Engine Python API facilitates the execution of data collection and retrieval which is entirely cloud-based. For soil moisture retrieval, it eliminates the requirement to download or preprocess any input datasets."
An Integrated Statistical-Machine Learning Approach for Runoff Prediction,"Abhinav Kumar Singh, Pankaj Kumar, Rawshan Ali, Nadhir Al‐Ansari, Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma, Kuldeep Singh Kushwaha, Kanhu Charan Panda, Atish Sagar, Ehsan Mirzania, Ahmed Elbeltagi, Alban Kuriqi, Salim Heddam",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/su14138209,https://openalex.org/W4284898335,"Nowadays, great attention has been attributed to the study of runoff and its fluctuation over space and time. There is a crucial need for a good soil and water management system to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and other natural adverse events like floods and landslides, among others. Rainfall–runoff (R-R) modeling is an appropriate approach for runoff prediction, making it possible to take preventive measures to avoid damage caused by natural hazards such as floods. In the present study, several data-driven models, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were used for rainfall–runoff prediction of the Gola watershed, located in the south-eastern part of the Uttarakhand. The rainfall–runoff model analysis was conducted using daily rainfall and runoff data for 12 years (2009 to 2020) of the Gola watershed. The first 80% of the complete data was used to train the model, and the remaining 20% was used for the testing period. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBAIS) indices. In addition to the numerical comparison, the models were evaluated. Their performances were evaluated based on graphical plotting, i.e., time-series line diagram, scatter plot, violin plot, relative error plot, and Taylor diagram (TD). The comparison results revealed that the four heuristic methods gave higher accuracy than the MLR model. Among the machine learning models, the RF (RMSE (m3/s), R2, NSE, and PBIAS (%) = 6.31, 0.96, 0.94, and −0.20 during the training period, respectively, and 5.53, 0.95, 0.92, and −0.20 during the testing period, respectively) surpassed the MARS, SVM, and the MLR models in forecasting daily runoff for all cases studied. The RF model outperformed in all four models’ training and testing periods. It can be summarized that the RF model is best-in-class and delivers a strong potential for the runoff prediction of the Gola watershed."

We identified 66 shallow landslide locations, based on field surveys, by recording the locations of the landslides by a global position System (GPS), Google Earth imagery and black-and-white aerial photographs (scale 1: 20,000) and 19 landslide conditioning factors, then tested these factors using the information gain ratio (IGR) technique. We checked the validity of the models using statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We found that, although all three machine learning algorithms yielded excellent performance, the SVM algorithm (AUC = 0.984) slightly outperformed the BLR (AUC = 0.980), and ADTree (AUC = 0.977) algorithms. We observed that not only all three algorithms are useful and effective tools for identifying shallow landslide-prone areas but also the BLR algorithm can be used such as the SVM algorithm as a soft computing benchmark algorithm to check the performance of the models in future."

However, delineating the spatial occurrence pattern of the landslide remains a challenge. This study investigates the potential application of the stacking ensemble learning technique for landslide susceptibility assessment. In particular, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), logical regression (LR), and naive Bayes (NB) were selected as base learners for the stacking ensemble method. The resampling scheme and Pearson’s correlation analysis were jointly used to evaluate the importance level of these base learners. A total of 388 landslides and 12 conditioning factors in the Lushui area (Southwest China) were used as the dataset to develop landslide modeling. The landslides were randomly separated into two parts, with 70% used for model training and 30% used for model validation. The models’ performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and statistical measures. The results showed that the stacking-based ensemble model achieved an improved predictive accuracy as compared to the single algorithms, while the SVM-ANN-NB-LR (SANL) model, the SVM-ANN-NB (SAN) model, and the ANN-NB-LR (ANL) models performed equally well, with AUC values of 0.931, 0.940, and 0.932, respectively, for validation stage. The correlation coefficient between the LR and SVM was the highest for all resampling rounds, with a value of 0.72 on average. This connotes that LR and SVM played an almost equal role when the ensemble of SANL was applied for landslide susceptibility analysis. Therefore, it is feasible to use the SAN model or the ANL model for the study area. The finding from this study suggests that the stacking ensemble machine learning method is promising for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Lushui area and is capable of targeting areas prone to landslides."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Considering Regional Soil Erosion Based on Machine-Learning Models,"Faming Huang, Jiawu Chen, Zhen Du, Chi Yao, Jinsong Huang, Qinghui Jiang, Zhilu Chang, Shu Li",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9060377,https://openalex.org/W3035405765,"Soil erosion (SE) provides slide mass sources for landslide formation, and reflects long-term rainfall erosion destruction of landslides. Therefore, it is possible to obtain more reliable landslide susceptibility prediction results by introducing SE as a geology and hydrology-related predisposing factor. The Ningdu County of China is taken as a research area. Firstly, 446 landslides are obtained through government disaster survey reports. Secondly, the SE amount in Ningdu County is calculated and nine other conventional predisposing factors are obtained under both 30 m and 60 m grid resolutions to determine the effects of SE on landslide susceptibility prediction. Thirdly, four types of machine-learning predictors with 30 m and 60 m grid resolutions—C5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT), logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM)—are applied to construct the landslide susceptibility prediction models considering the SE factor as SE-C5.0 DT, SE-LR, SE-MLP and SE-SVM models; C5.0 DT, LR, MLP and SVM models with no SE are also used for comparisons. Finally, the area under receiver operating feature curve is used to verify the prediction accuracy of these models, and the relative importance of all the 10 predisposing factors is ranked. The results indicate that: (1) SE factor plays the most important role in landslide susceptibility prediction among all 10 predisposing factors under both 30 m and 60 m resolutions; (2) the SE-based models have more accurate landslide susceptibility prediction than the single models with no SE factor; (3) all the models with 30 m resolutions have higher landslide susceptibility prediction accuracy than those with 60 m resolutions; and (4) the C5.0 DT and SVM models show higher landslide susceptibility prediction performance than the MLP and LR models."
Uncertainties of landslide susceptibility prediction considering different landslide types,"Faming Huang, Haowen Xiong, Chi Yao, Filippo Catani, Chuangbing Zhou, Jinsong Huang",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2023.03.001,https://openalex.org/W4327921906,"Most literature related to landslide susceptibility prediction only considers a single type of landslide, such as colluvial landslide, rock fall or debris flow, rather than different landslide types, which greatly affects susceptibility prediction performance. To construct efficient susceptibility prediction considering different landslide types, Huichang County in China is taken as example. Firstly, 105 rock falls, 350 colluvial landslides and 11 related environmental factors are identified. Then four machine learning models, namely logistic regression, multi-layer perception, support vector machine and C5.0 decision tree are applied for susceptibility modeling of rock fall and colluvial landslide. Thirdly, three different landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) models considering landslide types based on C5.0 decision tree with excellent performance are constructed to generate final landslide susceptibility: (i) united method, which combines all landslide types directly; (ii) probability statistical method, which couples analyses of susceptibility indices under different landslide types based on probability formula; and (iii) maximum comparison method, which selects the maximum susceptibility index through comparing the predicted susceptibility indices under different types of landslides. Finally, uncertainties of landslide susceptibility are assessed by prediction accuracy, mean value and standard deviation. It is concluded that LSP results of the three coupled models considering landslide types basically conform to the spatial occurrence patterns of landslides in Huichang County. The united method has the best susceptibility prediction performance, followed by the probability method and maximum susceptibility method. More cases are needed to verify this result in-depth. LSP considering different landslide types is superior to that taking only a single type of landslide into account."

Several machine learning methods have been examined for this purpose, underlying deep learning (DL) models’ remarkable prediction capabilities. The long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms are the sole DL model studied in the extant comparisons. However, several other DL algorithms are suitable for time series forecasting tasks. In this paper, we assess, compare, and describe seven DL methods for forecasting future landslide displacement: multi-layer perception (MLP), LSTM, GRU, 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN), 2xLSTM, bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM), and an architecture composed of 1D CNN and LSTM (Conv-LSTM). The investigation focuses on four landslides with different geographic locations, geological settings, time step dimensions, and measurement instruments. Two landslides are located in an artificial reservoir context, while the displacement of the other two is influenced just by rainfall. The results reveal that the MLP, GRU, and LSTM models can make reliable predictions in all four scenarios, while the Conv-LSTM model outperforms the others in the Baishuihe landslide, where the landslide is highly seasonal. No evident performance differences were found for landslides inside artificial reservoirs rather than outside. Furthermore, the research shows that MLP is better adapted to forecast the highest displacement peaks, while LSTM and GRU are better suited to model lower displacement peaks. We believe the findings of this research will serve as a precious aid when implementing a DL-based landslide early warning system (LEWS)."

Toward this end, this paper presents a case study in Ningqiang County, Shanxi Province, China. Slope units were selected as the basic mapping units. A traditional statistical certainty factor model (CF), a machine learning support vector machine model (SVM) and random forest model (RF), along with a hybrid CF-SVM model and a CF-RF model were applied to analyze landslide susceptibility. Firstly, 10 landslide conditioning factors were selected, namely slope-angle, altitude, slope aspect, degree of relief, lithology, distance to rivers, distance to faults, distance to roads, average annual rainfall and normalized difference vegetation index. The 23,169 slope units were generated from a Digital Elevation Model and the corresponding 10 conditioning factor layers were produced from both geological and geographical data. Then, landslide susceptibility mapping was carried out using the five models, respectively. Next, the landslide density (LD), frequency ratio (FR), the area under the curve (AUC) and other indicators were used to validate the rationality, performance and accuracy of the models. The results showed that the susceptibility maps produced from the different models were all reasonable. In each map, the LD and FR were greatest in the zones classed as having very high landslide susceptibility, followed by the high, moderate, low and very low landslide susceptibility classes, respectively. From the comparison of the different maps and ROC curves, the RF model based on slope units was the most appropriate for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. It was also found that the combination of weaker learner model (CF model here) with a stronger learner model (SVM and RF model here) can impact the applicability of the stronger model."

In this study, Scoops 3D was employed as a physics-informed tool to qualitatively assess slope stability in the study area (the Hubei Province section of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area). The non-landslide samples were extracted based on the calculated factor of safety (FS). Subsequently, the random forest algorithm was employed for data-driven landslide susceptibility analysis, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) serving as the model evaluation index. Compared to the benchmark model (i.e., the standard method of utilizing the pure random forest algorithm), the proposed method's AUC value improved by 20.1%, validating the effectiveness of the dual-driven method (physics-informed data-driven).d."

Anomaly detection, logistic regression, and decomposition analysis performed well for all scenarios under study, with the area under the curve averaging 0.951, 0.911, and 0.896, respectively. Moreover, the prediction accuracy of linear regression had a mean absolute percentage error of 0.255. To the best of our knowledge, our scenario-based ML knowledge discovery system is the first of its kind to provide a comprehensive understanding of global landslide data."

Hence, it is imperative to map the areas susceptible to landslides to minimize their risk. Around Abbottabad, a large city in northern Pakistan, a large number of landslides can be found. This study aimed to map the landslide susceptibility over these regions in Pakistan by using three Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Linear Regression (LiR), Logistic Regression (LoR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Several influencing factors were used to identify the potential landslide areas, including elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, general curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, landcover classification system, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil, lithology, fault density, topographic roughness index, and road density. The weights of these factors were calculated using ML techniques. The weightage overlay tool is adopted to map the final output. According to three ML models, lithology, NDWI, slope, and LCCS significantly impact landslide occurrence. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is applied to validate the performance of models, and the results show the AUC value of LiR (88%) is better than SVM (86%) and LoR (85%) models. ML models and final susceptibility map gives good accuracy, which can be reliable for the results. The study’s outcome provides baselines for policymakers to propose adequate protection and mitigation measures against the landslides in the region, and any other researcher can adopt this methodology to map the landslide susceptibility in another area having similar characteristics."

Landslide events occur nearly every year in the Arhavi, Hopa, and Kemalpaşa districts located on the Black Sea coast in the Artvin province. In this study, the landslide susceptibility map of the Arhavi, Hopa, and Kemalpaşa districts was produced using the random forest (RF) model, which is widely used in the literature and yields more accurate results compared with other machine learning techniques. A total of 10 landslide-conditioning factors were considered for the susceptibility analysis, i.e., lithology, land cover, slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, topographic wetness index, and distances from faults, drainage networks, and roads. Furthermore, 70% of the landslides on the landslide inventory map were used for training, and the remaining 30% were used for validation. The RF-based model was validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Evaluation results indicated that the success and prediction rates of the model were 98.3% and 97.7%, respectively. Moreover, it was determined that incorrect land-use decisions, such as transforming forest areas into tea and hazelnut cultivation areas, induce the occurrence of landslides."
"Slope stability prediction based on a long short-term memory neural network: comparisons with convolutional neural networks, support vector machines and random forest models","Faming Huang, Haowen Xiong, Shixuan Chen, Zhitao Lv, Jinsong Huang, Zhilu Chang, Filippo Catani",2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40789-023-00579-4,https://openalex.org/W4363673045,"Abstract The numerical simulation and slope stability prediction are the focus of slope disaster research. Recently, machine learning models are commonly used in the slope stability prediction. However, these machine learning models have some problems, such as poor nonlinear performance, local optimum and incomplete factors feature extraction. These issues can affect the accuracy of slope stability prediction. Therefore, a deep learning algorithm called Long short-term memory (LSTM) has been innovatively proposed to predict slope stability. Taking the Ganzhou City in China as the study area, the landslide inventory and their characteristics of geotechnical parameters, slope height and slope angle are analyzed. Based on these characteristics, typical soil slopes are constructed using the Geo-Studio software. Five control factors affecting slope stability, including slope height, slope angle, internal friction angle, cohesion and volumetric weight, are selected to form different slope and construct model input variables. Then, the limit equilibrium method is used to calculate the stability coefficients of these typical soil slopes under different control factors. Each slope stability coefficient and its corresponding control factors is a slope sample. As a result, a total of 2160 training samples and 450 testing samples are constructed. These sample sets are imported into LSTM for modelling and compared with the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results show that the LSTM overcomes the problem that the commonly used machine learning models have difficulty extracting global features. Furthermore, LSTM has a better prediction performance for slope stability compared to SVM, RF and CNN models."
Landslide and Wildfire Susceptibility Assessment in Southeast Asia Using Ensemble Machine Learning Methods,"Qian He, Ziyu Jiang, Ming Wang, Kai Liu",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13081572,https://openalex.org/W3154188595,"Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region affected by landslide and wildfire; however, few studies on susceptibility modeling for the two hazards together have been conducted for this region, and the intersection and the uncertainty of the two hazards are rarely assessed. Thus, the intersection of landslide and wildfire susceptibility and the spatial uncertainty of the susceptibility maps were studied in this paper. Reliable landslide and wildfire susceptibility maps are necessary for disaster management and land use planning. This work used three advanced ensemble machine learning algorithms: RF (Random Forest), GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) and AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) to assess the landslide and wildfire susceptibility for SEA. A geo-database was established with 2759 landslide locations, 1633 wildfire locations and 18 predictor variables in total. The performances of the models were assessed using the overall classification accuracy (ACC), Precision, the area under the ROC (receiver operating curve) (AUC) and confusion matrix values. The results showed RF performs superior in both landslide (ACC = 0.81, Precision = 0.78 and AUC= 0.89) and wildfire (ACC= 0.83, Precision = 0.83 and AUC = 0.91) susceptibility modeling, followed by GBDT and AdaBoost. The overall superiority of RF over other models indicates that it is potentially an efficient model for landslide and wildfire susceptibility mapping. The landslide and wildfire susceptibility were obtained using the RF model. This paper also conducted an overlay analysis of the two hazards. The uncertainty of the susceptibility was further assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV). Additionally, the distance to roads is relatively important in both landslide and wildfire susceptibility, which is the most important in landslides and the second most important in wildfires. The result of this paper is useful for mastering the whole situation of hazard susceptibility and proves that RF is a robust model in the hazard susceptibility assessment in SEA."
"AI-Based Susceptibility Analysis of Shallow Landslides Induced by Heavy Rainfall in Tianshui, China","Tianjun Qi, Yan Zhao, Xingmin Meng, Guan Chen, Tom Dijkstra",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13091819,https://openalex.org/W3163899184,"Groups of landslides induced by heavy rainfall are widely distributed on a global basis and they usually result in major losses of human life and economic damage. However, compared with landslides induced by earthquakes, inventories of landslides induced by heavy rainfall are much less common. In this study we used high-precision remote sensing images before and after continuous heavy rainfall in southern Tianshui, China, from 20 June to 25 July 2013, to produce an inventory of 14,397 shallow landslides. Based on the results of landslide inventory, we utilized machine learning and the geographic information system (GIS) to map landslide susceptibility in this area and evaluated the relative weight of various factors affecting landslide development. First, 18 variables related to geomorphic conditions, slope material, geological conditions, and human activities were selected through collinearity analysis; second, 21 selected machine learning models were trained and optimized in the Python environment to evaluate the susceptibility of landslides. The results showed that the ExtraTrees model was the most effective for landslide susceptibility assessment, with an accuracy of 0.91. This predictive ability means that our landslide susceptibility results can be used in the implementation of landslide prevention and mitigation measures in the region. Analysis of the importance of the factors showed that the contribution of slope aspect (SA) was significantly higher than that of the other factors, followed by planar curvature (PLC), distance to river (DR), distance to fault (DTF), normalized difference vehicle index (NDVI), distance to road (DTR), and other factors. We conclude that factors related to geomorphic conditions are principally responsible for controlling landslide susceptibility in the study area."
Landslide Susceptibility Assessment of Wildfire Burnt Areas through Earth-Observation Techniques and a Machine Learning-Based Approach,"Mariano Di Napoli, Palmira Marsiglia, Diego Di Martire, Massimo Ramondini, Silvia Liberata Ullo, Domenico Calcaterra",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12152505,https://openalex.org/W3047019821,"Climate change has increased the likelihood of the occurrence of disasters like wildfires, floods, storms, and landslides worldwide in the last years. Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment."
Application of Machine Learning to Debris Flow Susceptibility Mapping along the China–Pakistan Karakoram Highway,"Feng Qing, Yan Zhao, Xingmin Meng, Xiaojun Su, Tianjun Qi, Dongxia Yue",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12182933,https://openalex.org/W3086117727,"The China–Pakistan Karakoram Highway is an important land route from China to South Asia and the Middle East via Pakistan. Due to the extremely hazardous geological environment around the highway, landslides, debris flows, collapses, and subsidence are frequent. Among them, debris flows are one of the most serious geological hazards on the Karakoram Highway, and they often cause interruptions to traffic and casualties. Therefore, the development of debris flow susceptibility mapping along the highway can potentially facilitate its safe operation. In this study, we used remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning techniques to map debris flow susceptibility along the Karakoram Highway in areas where observation data are scarce and difficult to obtain by field survey. First, the distribution of 544 catchments which are prone to debris flow were identified through visual interpretation of remote sensing images. The factors influencing debris flow susceptibility were then analyzed, and a total of 17 parameters related to geomorphology, soil materials, and triggering conditions were selected. Model training was based on multiple common machine learning methods, including Ensemble Methods, Gaussian Processes, Generalized Linear models, Navies Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Trees, Discriminant Analysis, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Support Vector Classification (SVC) was chosen as the final model after evaluation; its accuracy (ACC) was 0.91, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.96. Among the factors involved in SVC, the Melton Ratio (MR) was the most important, followed by drainage density (DD), Hypsometric Integral (HI), and average slope (AS), indicating that geomorphic conditions play an important role in predicting debris flow susceptibility in the study area. SVC was used to map debris flow susceptibility in the study area, and the results will potentially facilitate the safe operation of the highway."

Consequently, landslide risk assessment has become requisite for managing the resources in future. This study was designed to develop four ensemble metaheuristic machine learning algorithms, such as grey wolf optimized based artificial neural network (GW-ANN), grey wolf optimized based random forest (GW-RF), particle swarm optimization optimized based ANN (PSO-ANN), and PSO optimized based RF for modeling rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility (LS) in Aqabat Al-Sulbat, Asir region, Saudi Arabia, which observes landslide frequently. To obtain very high precision and robust prediction from machine learning algorithms, the grey wolf and PSO optimization algorithms were integrated to develop new ensemble machine learning techniques. Subsequently, LS maps produced by training dataset were validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve based on the testing dataset. Based on the area under curve (AUC) value of ROC curve, the best method for LS modeling was selected. We developed ROC curve-based sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of the parameters for LS modeling. The Gumble extreme value distribution was employed to estimate the rainfall at 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 year return periods. Then, the landslide hazard maps were prepared at different return periods by integrating the best LS model and estimated rainfall at different return periods. The theory of danger pixels was employed to prepare a final risk assessment of the resources, which have been exposed to the landslide. The results showed that 27–42 and 6–15 km2 were predicted as the very high and high LS zones using four ensemble metaheuristic machine learning algorithms. Based on the area under curve (AUC) of ROC, GR-ANN (AUC-0.905) appeared as the best model for LS modeling. The areas under high and very high landslide hazard were gradually increased over the progression of time (26 km2 at the 2 year return period and 40 km2 at the 100 year return period for the high landslide hazard zone, and 6 km2 at the 2 year return period and 20 km2 at the 100 year return period for the very high landslide hazard zone). Similarly, the areas of danger pixel also increased gradually from the 2 to 100 year return periods (37 km2 to 62 km2). Various natural resources, such as scrubland, built up, and sparse vegetation, were identified under risk zone due to landslide hazards. In addition, these resources would be exposed extensively to landslides over the advancement of return periods. Therefore, the outcome of the present study will help planners and scientists to propose high precision management plans for protecting natural resources, which have been exposed to landslides."
Mapping landslides from EO data using deep-learning methods,"Nikhil Prakash, Andrea Manconi, Simon Loew",2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-11876,https://openalex.org/W3112315548,"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Landslide hazard has always been a significant source of economic losses and fatalities in the mountainous regions. Knowledge of the spatial extent of the past and present landslide activity, compiled in the form of a landslide inventory map, is essential for effective risk management. High-resolution data acquired by Earth observation (EO) satellites are often used to map landslides by identifying morphological expressions that can be associated with past and/or recent deformation. This is a slow and difficult process as it requires extensive manual efforts. As a result, such maps are not readily available for all the landslide hazard affected regions. Fully automated methods are required to exploit the exponentially increasing amount of EO data available for landslide hazard assessments. In this context, conventional methods like pixel-based and object-based machine learning strategies have been studied extensively in the last decade. Recent advances in convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of deep-learning method, has outperformed other conventional learning methods in similar image interpretation tasks. In this work, we present a deep-learning based method for semantic segmentation of landslides from EO images. We present the results from a study area in the south of Portland in Oregon, USA. The landslide inventory for training and ground truth was extracted from the Statewide Landslide Information Database of Oregon (SLIDO). We were able to achieve a probability of detection (POD) greater than 0.70.

The results of these methods are sensitive to different factors, such as the quality of input data, choice of algorithm, sampling strategies, and data splitting ratios. In this study, five different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used for LSM for the Wayanad district in Kerala, India, using two different sampling strategies and nine different train to test ratios in cross validation. The results show that Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms provide better results than Naïve Bayes (NB) and Logistic Regression (LR) for the study area. NB and LR algorithms are less sensitive to the sampling strategy and data splitting, while the performance of the other three algorithms is considerably influenced by the sampling strategy. From the results, both the choice of algorithm and sampling strategy are critical in obtaining the best suited landslide susceptibility map for a region. The accuracies of KNN, RF, and SVM algorithms have increased by 10.51%, 10.02%, and 4.98% with the use of polygon landslide inventory data, while for NB and LR algorithms, the performance was slightly reduced with the use of polygon data. Thus, the sampling strategy and data splitting ratio are less consequential with NB and algorithms, while more data points provide better results for KNN, RF, and SVM algorithms."

The objective of this study is to introduce a CNN-based model in LSM and systematically compare its overall performance with the conventional machine learning models of random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine. Herein, we selected Zhangzha Town in Sichuan Province, China, and Lantau Island in Hong Kong, China, as the study areas. Each landslide inventory and corresponding predisposing factors were stacked to form spatial datasets for LSM. The receiver operating characteristic analysis, area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical metrics, such as accuracy, root mean square error, Kappa coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity, were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Finally, the trained models were calculated, and the landslide susceptibility zones were mapped. Results suggest that both CNN and conventional machine learning-based models have a satisfactory performance. The CNN-based model exhibits an excellent prediction capability and achieves the highest performance but also significantly reduces the salt-of-pepper effect, which indicates its great potential for application to LSM."
The performance of landslide susceptibility models critically depends on the quality of digital elevation models,"Jonas Brock, Patrick Schratz, Helene Petschko, Jannes Muenchow, Mihai Micu, Alexander Brenning",2020,https://doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2020.1776403,https://openalex.org/W3034212091,"Considering the critical importance of the quality of input data for landslide susceptibility, we investigate the performance improvements that can be achieved by different globally available digital elevation models (DEMs) using different state-of-the-art statistical and machine-learning models. For this purpose we compare the predictive performances achieved using terrain attributes derived from TanDEM-X DEM (12 m resolution and resampled to 30 m), ASTER DEM (30 m), SRTM DEM (30 m), and a DEM (25 m) interpolated from contour lines (1:25.000 map scale), exploiting the capabilities of logistic regression, generalized additive models, random forests and support vector machines. The study was conducted in the Buzău Sector of the Curvature Subcarpathians of Romania, a region highly susceptible to landslides. While the performances varied little among modelling techniques, the use of different DEMs strongly influenced the cross-validation accuracy of landslide susceptibility models. TanDEM-X (12 m) based susceptibility models outperformed models based on the other DEMs (median Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUROC) values 0.708–0.730). Models using ASTER-derived terrain attributes showed the poorest predictive capabilities (median AUROC 0.568–0.595). We conclude that the quality of DEMs is of critical importance in landslide susceptibility modelling, and greater efforts should be made to obtain suitable DEM products."

Hence, early warning systems of such disasters can alert people and save lives. Some of the recent early warning models make use of Internet of Things to monitor the environmental parameters to predict the disasters. Some other models use machine learning techniques (MLT) to analyse rainfall data along with some internal parameters to predict these hazards. The prediction capability of the existing models and systems are limited in terms of their accuracy. In this research paper, two prediction modelling approaches, namely random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR), are proposed. These approaches use rainfall datasets as well as various other internal and external parameters for landslide prediction and hence improve the accuracy. Moreover, the prediction performance of these approaches is further improved using antecedent cumulative rainfall data. These models are evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics, area under the curve (ROC-AUC) and false negative rate (FNR) to measure the landslide cases that were not reported. When antecedent rainfall data is included in the prediction, both models (RF and LR) performed better with an AUC of 0.995 and 0.997, respectively. The results proved that there is a good correlation between antecedent precipitation and landslide occurrence rather than between one-day rainfall and landslide occurrence. In terms of incorrect predictions, RF and LR improved FNR to 10.58% and 5.77% respectively. It is also noted that among the various internal factors used for prediction, slope angle has the highest impact than other factors. Comparing both the models, LR model’s performance is better in terms of FNR and it could be preferred for landslide prediction and early warning. LR model’s incorrect prediction rate FNR = 9.61% without including antecedent precipitation data and 3.84% including antecedent precipitation data."

Many landslide casual factors are often generated from DEMs. Most studies on landslide susceptibility assessments rely on freely available DEMs. However, very little is known about the performance of different DEMs with varying spatial resolutions on the accurate assessment of landslide susceptibility. This study compared the performance of four different DEMs including 30 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), 30–90 m Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), 12.5 m Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and 25 m Survey of Bangladesh (SOB) DEM in landslide susceptibility assessment in the Rangamati district in Bangladesh. This study used three different landslide susceptibility assessment techniques: modified frequency ratio (bivariate model), logistic regression (multivariate model), and random forest (machine-learning model). This study explored two scenarios of landslide susceptibility assessment: using only DEM-derived causal factors and using both DEM-derived factors as well as other common factors. The success and prediction rate curves indicate that the SRTM DEM provides the highest accuracies for the bivariate model in both scenarios. Results also reveal that the ALOS PALSAR DEM shows the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping using the logistics regression and the random forest models. A relatively finer resolution DEM, the SOB DEM, shows the lowest accuracies compared to other DEMs for all models and scenarios. It can also be noted that the performance of all DEMs except the SOB DEM is close (72%–84%) considering the success and prediction accuracies. Therefore, anyone of the three global DEMs: ASTER, SRTM, and ALOS PALSAR can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area."

The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the “reach angle” method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed."

Firstly, by using aerial photos and geological field surveys, the 263 landslide locations in the study area were obtained. Next, the identified landslides were randomly classified according to the ratio of 70/30 to construct training data and validation models, respectively. Secondly, based on the landslide inventory map, combined with the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the study area, 14 affecting factors of the landslide were determined. The predictive ability of the selected factors was evaluated using the LSVM model. Using the WoE model, the relationship between landslides and affecting factors was analyzed by positive and negative correlation methods. The above three hybrid models were then used to map landslide susceptibility. Thirdly, the ROC curve and various statistical data (SE, 95% CI and MAE) were used to verify and compare the predictive power of the model. Compared with the other two models, the Sysfor model had a larger area under the curve (AUC) of 0.876 (training dataset) and 0.783 (validation dataset). Finally, by quantitatively comparing the susceptibility values of each pixel, the differences in spatial morphology of landslide susceptibility maps were compared, and the model was found to have limitations and effectiveness. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained by the three models are reasonable, and the landslide susceptibility maps generated by the SysFor model have the highest comprehensive performance. The results obtained in this paper can help local governments in land use planning, disaster reduction and environmental protection."

Because the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate about 50 million years ago, the Tibet plateau has suffered from the world's most active tectonic movement. Hence, numerous active faults are widespread over the regions covering the Sichuan-Tibet railway (Figure 1A). Most of the active faults are characterized by a large motion rate and frequent seismicity. One notable example is the Xianshuihe fault zone, which slips at a rate of 9–12 mm year-1 and has experienced more than 10 earthquakes of M > 6.5 over 1,700 years. The severe challenges for Sichuan-Tibet railway, generated by active faults, are reflected in three main aspects. First, the railway could be dislocated by its intersecting active faults. This dislocation depends not only on the continuous fault creep-slip, but also on the surface rupture caused by earthquakes. Second, a devastating earthquake could destroy the railway structures, including bridges, tunnels, and station buildings because of tremors. Finally, fault motion could trigger chains of geological hazards. Specifically, fault creep-slip and seismic activities could form and widen cracks on mountain crests or flanks, increasing the frequency of rockfalls, landslides, or debris flows.5Fan X. Scaringi G. Korup O. et al.Earthquake-induced chains of geologic hazards: patterns, mechanisms, and impacts.Rev. Geophys. 2019; 57: 421-503Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar Landslides could block rivers and cause huge lakes, subsequently collapsing and flooding downstream areas. Previous seismic hazard events imply that the hazard chains will affect the Sichuan-Tibet railway for much longer than the relatively brief quake tremors from earthquakes. Along the Sichuan-Tibet railway, the steep topography and densely fractured lithology arise from interactions among tectonic uplift, valley incision, and fault motion, eventually triggering the world's most numerous mountain hazards. Large-scale mountain hazards are readily encountered along the railway, reflected by 418 rockfalls, 580 landslides, and 1,132 debris flows.3Guo C. Zhang Y. Yang Z. et al.The investigation on the active faults along the Sichuan-Tibet railway and their geological hazard effects. Geological Publishing House, 2018Google Scholar Meanwhile, mountain hazards are clustered in a much wider corridor along the active fault.1Xue Y. Kong F. Yang W. et al.Main unfavorable geological conditions and engineering geological problems along Sichuan-Tibet railway.Chinese. J. Rock. Mech. Eng. 2020; 39: 445-468Google Scholar These hazards could destroy the railway, the infrastructures, and the ecosystems, impeding railway operation and probably provoking hazard chains. Moreover, the increasingly extreme weather increases the frequency of hazard chains along the railway. Climatic warming is promoting glacial ablation and forming many glacier lakes, which could collapse later and generate floods, probably evolving into debris flows. Also, extreme drought can damage the vegetation cover. The exposed rock is sensitive to rainstorms causing more debris flows than would occur normally. Also, extreme rainfall events can trigger rockfalls and landslides. Landslide debris on slopes can be further remobilized by rainfall and generate debris flows.5Fan X. Scaringi G. Korup O. et al.Earthquake-induced chains of geologic hazards: patterns, mechanisms, and impacts.Rev. Geophys. 2019; 57: 421-503Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar The Sichuan-Tibet railway passes through the Chinese Loess Plateau-Sichuan-Yunnan ecological barrier, the Tibet plateau ecological barrier, the Qionglai mountain biodiversity reserve, and the Gonggashan national natural reserve. Nearly 100 rare plant and animal species live in these areas.4Lu C. Cai C. Challenges and countermeasures for construction safety during the Sichuan-Tibet railway project.Engineering. 2019; 5: 833-838Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar The Tibet plateau is the source of many rivers and also plays an important role in regulating the climate of the Northern hemisphere. Thus, the ecosystem is complex, and ecological environment protection is the top priority during railway construction. Corresponding to the wide-ranging topography relief and extreme weather, rocks on the Tibet plateau can be weathered rapidly, which makes the ecological environment prone to soil erosion, land desertification, and mountain hazards. As such, the ecological environment along the Sichuan-Tibet railway is the most vulnerable in the world and easily affected by socio-economic activity. More specifically, the construction of the railway by building bridges, excavating tunnels, and cutting off hillslopes may destroy the vegetation, eventually leading to soil erosion and geological hazards. Vegetation recovery is notoriously tricky for biodiverse areas. Also, railway construction may impede the migratory route of wild animals. Thus, the vulnerability of nature will create unprecedented challenges for the preservation of the ecological environment. Regarding the successful construction of the Sichuan-Tibet railway, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the China State Railway Group first conducted correlated research decades ago and started the Special Funds Project in 2019. Here, several countermeasures are also recommended to transcend some of the existing challenges. To anticipate the short- or long-term hazard risks, an ""aerospace-aeronautics-ground-underground"" integrated monitoring and early warning system is required to be built using IoT (Internet of Things) and intelligence artificial technology. Global positioning satellites, remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicles, ground SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), and sensor integration technology will be used for monitoring the precursor information of mountain or underground geological hazards. The gathered data can be subsequently processed through artificial intelligence, where the hazard alert level can be identified. Finally, the hazard forewarning information will be published in real time. Concurrently, new building materials and structures are required to resist earthquake fault dislocation. The new material can automatically heal the seismic cracks by releasing polymer composites. The new building structures for tunnels, using flexible joints that comprise hyperelastic and self-reset shape memory alloy (SMA) elements, can potentially resist the fault dislocation. Also, the self-reset SMA dampers can expend the impact energy of earthquakes. Moreover, to protect the ecological environment, the rock/soil dreg field should be kept away from rare wildlife habitats and water resource regions. Restoration of vegetation in dreg fields is necessary to prevent soil erosion and secondary geohazards. Overall, to transcend the existing challenges, new catastrophe theories, materials, and structures will have to be developed; and humankind needs to focus on learning how to realize harmonious intergrowth of nature and railways. All these innovations will promote the scientific and technological development of China and eventually the world."
Explainable artificial intelligence in geoscience: A glimpse into the future of landslide susceptibility modeling,"Ashok Dahal, Luigi Lombardo",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2023.105364,https://openalex.org/W4366086142,"For decades, the distinction between statistical models and machine learning ones has been clear. The former are optimized to produce interpretable results, whereas the latter seeks to maximize the predictive performance of the task at hand. This is valid for any scientific field and for any method belonging to the two categories mentioned above. When attempting to predict natural hazards, this difference has lead researchers to make drastic decisions on which aspect to prioritize, a difficult choice to make. In fact, one would always seek the highest performance because at higher performances correspond better decisions for disaster risk reduction. However, scientists also wish to understand the results, as a way to rely on the tool they developed. Today, very recent development in deep learning have brought forward a new generation of interpretable artificial intelligence, where the prediction power typical of machine learning tools is equipped with a level of explanatory power typical of statistical approaches. In this work, we attempt to demonstrate the capabilities of this new generation of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). To do so, we take the landslide susceptibility context as reference. Specifically, we build an XAI trained to model landslides occurred in response to the Gorkha earthquake (April 25, 2015), providing an educational overview of the model design and its querying opportunities. The results show high performance, with an AUC score of 0.89, while the interpretability can be extended to the probabilistic result assigned to single mapping units."
Rapid characterisation of landslide heterogeneity using unsupervised classification of electrical resistivity and seismic refraction surveys,"J. Whiteley, Arnaud Watlet, S. Uhlemann, Paul Wilkinson, James Boyd, Colm Jordan, J. M. Kendall, Jonathan Chambers",2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.106189,https://openalex.org/W3162310876,"The characterisation of the subsurface of a landslide is a critical step in developing ground models that inform planned mitigation measures, remediation works or future early-warning of instability. When a landslide failure may be imminent, the time pressures on producing such models may be great. Geoelectrical and seismic geophysical surveys are able to rapidly acquire volumetric data across large areas of the subsurface at the slope-scale. However, analysis of the individual model derived from each survey is typically undertaken in isolation, and a robust, accurate interpretation is highly dependent on the experience and skills of the operator. We demonstrate a machine learning process for constructing a rapid reconnaissance ground model, by integrating several sources of geophysical data in to a single ground model in a rapid and objective manner. Firstly, we use topographic data acquired by a UAV survey to co-locate three geophysical surveys of the Hollin Hill Landslide Observatory in the UK. The data are inverted using a joint 2D mesh, resulting in a set of co-located models of resistivity, P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity. Secondly, we analyse the relationships and trends present between the variables for each point in the mesh (resistivity, P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, depth) to identify correlations. Thirdly, we use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a form of unsupervised machine learning, to classify the geophysical data into cluster groups with similar ranges and trends in measurements. The resulting model created from probabilistically assigning each subsurface point to a cluster group characterises the heterogeneity of landslide materials based on their geophysical properties, identifying the major subsurface discontinuities at the site. Finally, we compare the results of the cluster groups to intrusive borehole data, which show good agreement with the spatial variations in lithology. We demonstrate the applicability of integrated geophysical surveys coupled with simple unsupervised machine learning for producing rapid reconnaissance ground models in time-critical situations with minimal prior knowledge about the subsurface."
Combining spatial response features and machine learning classifiers for landslide susceptibility mapping,"Ruilong Wei, Chengming Ye, Tianbo Sui, Yonggang Ge, Yao Li, Jonathan Li",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102681,https://openalex.org/W4205157077,"Reliable landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is essential for disaster prevention and mitigation. This study develops a deep learning framework that integrates spatial response features and machine learning classifiers (SR-ML). The method has three steps. First, depthwise separable convolution (DSC) extracts spatial features to prevent confusion of multi-factor features. Second, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) extracts response features to obtain features under different scales. Third, the high-level features are fused into prepared ML classifiers for more effective feature classification. This framework effectively extracts and uses different-dimension features of samples, explores ML classifiers for beneficial feature classification, and breaks through the limitation of fixed input sample sizes. In the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon region, data on 203 landslides and 11 conditioning factors were prepared for availability verification and LSM. The evaluation indicated that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the proposed SR and SR-ML achieved 0.920 and 0.910, which were 6.6% and 5.6% higher than the random forest (RF, with the highest AUC in ML group) method, respectively. Furthermore, the framework using 64×64 size inputs had the lowest mean error of 0.01, revealing that samples considering landslide scales could improve performance for LSM."

Different machine learning (ML) methods have been employed and compared to select the best results in the case study area. The CNN is compared with four ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). To do so, sixteen landslide causative factors have been extracted and their related spatial layers have been prepared. Then, the algorithms were trained with related landslide and non-landslide points. The results illustrate that the five ML algorithms performed suitably (precision = 82.43–85.6%, AUC = 0.934–0.967). The RF algorithm achieves the best result, while the CNN, SVM, the ANN, and the LR have the best results after RF, respectively, in this case study. Moreover, variable importance analysis results indicate that slope and topographic curvature contribute more to the prediction. The results would be beneficial to planning strategies for landslide risk management."

During the event, flash floods and several landslides caused losses of lives, evacuation of people from their homes, collapses of infrastructure and large constructions, destruction of agricultural fields, and many other economic losses. The meteorological conditions before and during the flood were analyzed here and compared with long-term records. The flood extent and the landslide susceptibility were investigated by using multisensor and multitemporal data. Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2 optical data, and aerial photogrammetric datasets were employed for the investigations using machine learning techniques. The changes were assessed both at a local and regional level and evaluated together with available damage reports. The analysis of the rainfall data recorded during the two weeks before the floods and landslides in heavily affected regions shows that the rainfall continued for consecutive hours with an amount of up to 68 mm/hour. The regional level classification results obtained from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data by using the random forest (RF) method exhibit 97% accuracy for the flood class. The landslide susceptibility prediction performance from aerial photogrammetric datasets was 92% represented by the Area Under Curve (AUC) value provided by the RF method. The results presented here show that considering the occurrence frequency and immense damages after such events, the use of novel remote sensing technologies and spatial analysis methods is unavoidable for disaster mitigation efforts and for the monitoring of environmental effects. Although the increasing number of earth observation satellites complemented with airborne imaging sensors is capable of ensuring data collection requirement with diverse spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions, further studies are required to automate the data processing, efficient information extraction, and data fusion and also to increase the accuracy of the results."
A Comparative Study of Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using SVM and PSO-SVM Models Based on Grid and Slope Units,"Shuai Zhao, Zhou Zhao",2021,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8854606,https://openalex.org/W3119286100,"The main purpose of this study aims to apply and compare the rationality of landslide susceptibility maps using support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization coupled with support vector machine (PSO-SVM) models in Lueyang County, China, enhance the connection with the natural terrain, and analyze the application of grid units and slope units. A total of 186 landslide locations were identified by earlier reports and field surveys. The landslide inventory was randomly divided into two parts: 70% for training dataset and 30% for validation dataset. Based on the multisource data and geological environment, 16 landslide conditioning factors were selected, including control factors and triggering factors (i.e., altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, SPI, TPI, TRI, lithology, distance to faults, TWI, distance to rivers, NDVI, distance to roads, land use, and rainfall). The susceptibility between each conditioning factor and landslide was deduced using a certainty factor model. Subsequently, combined with grid units and slope units, the landslide susceptibility models were carried out by using SVM and PSO-SVM methods. The precision capability of the landslide susceptibility mapping produced by different models and units was verified through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results showed that the PSO-SVM model based on slope units had the best performance in landslide susceptibility mapping, and the area under the curve (AUC) values of training and validation datasets are 0.945 and 0.9245, respectively. Hence, the machine learning algorithm coupled with slope units can be considered a reliable and effective technique in landslide susceptibility mapping."

Integrating machine learning models into landslide hazard analysis is a common but challenging task for researchers in general. In this work, we introduce a revolutionary framework, the Amazon's AutoGluon, a new open-source library of machine learning models, to analyze landslide hazards related to the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake in west China. We use 11 mathematical models in the AutoGluon to perform the analysis. For each model, the coseismic landslide inventory and 10 environmental and triggering factors are used as model inputs to perform landslide hazard analysis. These 10 factors are altitude, slope, aspect, slope position, distance parallel to the seismogenic fault, distance vertical to the seismogenic fault, distance to the epicenter, lithology, distance to rivers, and distance to roads. The same number (4,834) of random points in landslide and non-landslide areas are selected, 70 ​% of which are used as training points, and the remaining 30 ​% used as validation points. It takes 47.33 ​s for data preprocessing and model training for 11 machine learning models and the best result measured by Roc-AUC score is 0.94.

Unsupervised Feature Learning to Improve Transferability of Landslide Susceptibility Representations,"Qing Zhu, Li Chen, Han Hu, Saied Pirasteh, Haifeng Li, Xiao Xie",2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2020.3006192,https://openalex.org/W3038206524,"A landslide susceptibility map (LSM) is of vital importance for risk recognition and prevention. In the last decade, statistical methods have gradually exerted their impact on mapping the landslide susceptibility to locate the high-risk places of landslide. However, due to the complexity of getting full access to the thematic information in large scenarios, most of these statistical methods generally suffer from overfitting, inadequate representative power, and the inability to transfer the learned representation to other places. To solve these challenges, this study designed an unsupervised representation learning module, which features independence, compactness, robustness, and transferability. Specifically, we first stack restricted Boltzmann machines and denoising autoencoder to unsupervised discover the underlying representations embedded in the thematic maps. Then, we applied the transferring strategy in an adversarial manner to generalize the learned representations to the sample-scarce area. Experimental results and analyses using data in different regions have revealed that the proposed method can be generalized well between different LSM scenarios. In terms of precision, it outperforms other methods by a large margin, e.g., by around 7% compared to multilayer perceptrons with the same configuration, and by 3%–4% to the state of art algorithm random forest. Besides, compared to other methods, the landslide susceptibility map that is predicted by the proposed method featuring smoothness and stableness seems more reliable, and is more according to some prior knowledge that, for example, distance to the drainage, slope, and stratum, should exert dominant effects on the occurrence of a landslide."

In this context, research on landslide susceptibility modelling has become a topic of relevance and is in constant evolution. Though various machine-learning techniques (MLTs) have been identified for landslide susceptibility modelling, the uncertainty inherent in the models is rarely considered. The present study attempts to quantify the uncertainty associated with landslide prediction models by developing a new methodological framework based on the ensembles of the eight MLTs. This methodology has been tested at the highlands of the southern Western Ghats region (Kerala, India), where landslides have frequently been occurring. Fourteen landslide conditioning factors have been identified as part of this study, and their association was correlated with 671 historic landslides in the study area. The study used four ensemble models such as the mean of probabilities, the median of probabilities, the weighted mean of probabilities, and the committee average. The weighted mean of probability was proved to be the best model based on the average of 800 standalone MLTs, viz., receiver operating characteristics, true skill statistics, and area under curve with corresponding validation scores. Thereafter, an uncertainty analysis was carried out on the coefficient of variation. A confident map was generated to represent the distinct zonation of landslide susceptibility areas with definite uncertainty scales. Nearly 74% of the past landslides fall in the higher susceptibility-low uncertainty category. It is also inferred that such micro-level zonation based on MLTs may improve the efficiency of landslide susceptibility maps and may help in accurately identifying landslide-prone areas in the future. The confident maps thus generated can be used as a ready reference to the planners for the formulation of landslide adaptation strategies at micro-scales."

In this paper, a typical step-wise-characterized landslide (Caojiatuo landslide) in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area is selected, and a displacement prediction model of Extreme Learning Machine with Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO-ELM model) is proposed. By analyzing the monitoring data of landslide displacement, the time series of landslide displacement is decomposed into trend displacement and periodic displacement by using the moving average method. First, the trend displacement is fitted by the cubic polynomial with a robust weighted least square method. Then, combining with the internal evolution rule and the external influencing factors, it is concluded that the main external trigger factors of the periodic displacement are the changes of precipitation and water level in the reservoir area. Gray relational degree (GRG) analysis method is used to screen out the main influencing factors of landslide periodic displacement. With these factors as input items, the GWO-ELM model is used to predict the periodic displacement of the landslide. The outcomes are compared with the nonoptimized ELM model. The results show that, combined with the advantages of the GWO algorithm, such as few adjusting parameters and strong global search ability, the GWO-ELM model can effectively learn the change characteristics of data and has a better and relatively stable prediction accuracy."

For the purpose of exploring feature fusion based CNN models with greater reliability in LSM, this study proposes an ensemble model based on channel-expanded pre-trained CNN and traditional machine learning model (CPCNN-ML). In CPCNN-ML, pre-trained CNN with mature structure is modified to excavate high-level features of multichannel predisposing factor layers. LSM result is generated by traditional machine learning (ML) model based on hybrid feature of high-level features and numerical predisposing factors. Lantau Island, Hong Kong is selected as study area; temporal landslide inventory is used for model training and evaluation. Experimental results show that CPCNN-ML has ability to predict landslide occurrence with high reliability, especially the CPCNN-ML based on random forest. Contrast experiments with self-built CNN and traditional ML models further embody the superiority of CPCNN-ML. It is worth noting that coastal regions are newly identified landslide-prone regions compared with previous research. This finding is of great reference value for Hong Kong authorities to formulate appropriate disaster prevention and mitigation policies."

A receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, and robustness index was used to evaluate and compare landslide susceptibility models. The output of the model performance shows that the CDT-ADTree model is the more robust model for the landslide susceptibility where the AUC, accuracy, and precision are 0.981, 0.837, and 0.867, respectively, than the standalone model of CDT and ADTree model. Therefore, it is concluded that the CDT-ADTree ensemble model can be applied as a new promising technique for spatial prediction of the landslide in further studies."
Flash Flood Susceptibility Modeling and Magnitude Index Using Machine Learning and Geohydrological Models: A Modified Hybrid Approach,"Samy Ismail Elmahdy, Tarig Ali, Mohamed Mostafa Mohamed",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12172695,https://openalex.org/W3050424506,"In an arid region, flash floods (FF), as a response to climate changes, are the most hazardous causing massive destruction and losses to farms, human lives and infrastructure. A first step towards securing lives and infrastructure is the susceptibility mapping and predicting of occurrence sites of FF. Several studies have been applied using an ensemble machine learning model (EMLM) but measuring FF magnitude using a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (MCL) and geohydrological models have not been widely applied. This study aims to modify a hybrid approach by testing three machine learning models. These are boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), and naive Bayes tree (NBT) for FF susceptibility mapping at the northern part of the United Arab Emirates (NUAE). This is followed by applying a group of accuracy metrics (precision, recall and F1 score) and the receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The result demonstrated that the BRT has the highest performance for FF susceptibility mapping followed by the CART and NBT. After that, the produced FF map using the BRT was then modified by dividing it into seven basins, and a set of new FF conditioning parameters namely alluvial plain width, basin gradient and mean slope for each basin was calculated for measuring FF magnitude. The results showed that the mountainous and narrower basins (e.g., RAK, Masafi, Fujairah, and Rol Dadnah) have the highest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude, while the wider alluvial plains (e.g., Al Dhaid) have the lowest probability occurrence of FF and FF magnitude. The proposed approach is an effective approach to improve the susceptibility mapping of FF, landslides, land subsidence, and groundwater potentiality obtained using ensemble machine learning, which is used widely in the literature."

A total of 118 landslide locations were recorded and divided in the training and testing datasets. We selected 25 conditioning factors, and of these, we specified the most important ones by an information gain ratio (IGR) technique. We assessed the performance of the DP model using statistical measures including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-measure, and area under-the-receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Three benchmark algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), REPTree, and NBTree, were used to check the applicability of the proposed model. The results by IGR concluded that of the 25 conditioning factors, only 16 factors were important for our modeling procedure, and of these, distance to road, road density, lithology and land use were the four most significant factors. Results based on the testing dataset revealed that the DP model had the highest accuracy (0.926) of the compared algorithms, followed by NBTree (0.917), REPTree (0.903), and SVM (0.894). The landslide susceptibility maps prepared from the DP model with AUC = 0.870 performed the best. We consider the DP model a suitable tool for landslide susceptibility mapping."

Using the Muzaffarabad as a case study, this work compares the performance of three conventional Machine Learning (ML) techniques, namely Logistic Regression (LGR), Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and two Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, namely Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for the susceptibility mapping of landslides. Most of these techniques have been used in the region of Northern Pakistan before for the same purpose. However, this study for landslide susceptibility assessment compares the performance of various techniques and provides additional insights into the factors used by adopting multicollinearity analysis. Landslide-inducing factors considered in this research are lithology, slope, flow direction, fault lines, aspect, elevation, curvature, earthquakes, plan curvature, precipitation, profile curvature, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), roads, and waterways. Results show that SVM performs better than LGR and LR among ML models. On the other hand, the performance of AHP was better than TOPSIS. All the models rank slope, precipitation, elevation, lithology, NDWI, and flow direction as the top three most imperative landslide-inducing factors. Results show 80% accuracy in Landslide Susceptibility Maps (LSMs) from ML techniques. The accuracy of the produced map from the AHP model is 80%, but for TOPSIS, it is less (78%). In disaster planning, the produced LSMs can significantly help the decision-makers, town planners, and local management take necessary measures to decrease the loss of life and assets."

A comprehensive landslide inventory and a landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) along the Karakorum Highway were created in recent research. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) models were used to compare and forecast the association between causative parameters and landslides. These advanced machine learning (ML) models can measure environmental issues and risks for any area on a regional scale. Initially, 74 landslide locations were determined along the KKH to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data. The landslides were randomly divided into two sets for training and validation at a proportion of 7/3. Fifteen landslide conditioning variables were produced for susceptibility mapping. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar persistent scatterer interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique investigated the deformation movement of extracted models in the susceptible zones. It revealed a high line of sight (LOS) deformation velocity in both models’ sensitive zones. For accuracy comparison, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve approach was used, which showed 93.44% and 92.22% accuracy for XGBoost and RF, respectively. The XGBoost method produced superior results, combined with PS-InSAR results to create a new LSM for the area. This improved susceptibility model will aid in mitigating the landslide disaster, and the results may assist in the safe operation of the highway in the research area."

Deep learning methods can take advantage of the high-level representation and reconstruction of information from landslide-affecting factors. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based algorithm that combine classifiers of both deep learning and machine learning is proposed for landslide susceptibility assessment. A stacked autoencoder (StAE) and a sparse autoencoder (SpAE) both consist of an input layer for raw data, hidden layer for feature extraction, and output layer for classification and prediction. As a study case, Oda City and Gotsu City in Shimane Prefecture, southwestern Japan, were used for susceptibility assessment and prediction of landslides triggered by extreme rainfall. Results The prediction performance was compared by analyzing real landslide and non-landslide data. The prediction performance of random forest (RF) was evaluated as better than that of a support vector machine (SVM) in traditional machine learning, so RF was combined with both StAE and SpAE. The results show that the prediction ratio of the combined classifiers was 93.2% for StAE combined with RF model and 92.5% for SpAE combined with RF model, which were higher than those of the SVM (87.4%), RF (89.7%), StAE (84.2%), and SpAE (88.2%). Conclusions This study provides an example of combined classifiers giving a better predictive ratio than a single classifier. The asymmetric and unsupervised autoencoder combined with RF can exploit optimal non-linear features from landslide-affecting factors successfully, outperforms some conventional machine learning methods, and is promising for landslide susceptibility assessment."

This study focuses on the comparison of the prediction capability of advanced machine learning techniques for the rainfall-induced shallow landslide susceptibility of Deokjeokri catchment and Karisanri catchment in South Korea. The influencing factors for landslides, i.e., topographic, hydrologic, soil, forest, and geologic factors, are prepared from various sources based on availability, and a multicollinearity test is also performed to select relevant causative factors. The landslide inventory maps of both catchments are obtained from historical information, aerial photographs and performed field surveys. In this study, Deokjeokri catchment is considered as a training area and Karisanri catchment as a testing area. The landslide inventories contain 748 landslide points in training and 219 points in testing areas. Three landslide susceptibility maps using machine learning models, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Deep Neural Network (DNN), are prepared and compared. The outcomes of the analyses are validated using the landslide inventory data. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) method is used to verify the results of the models. The results of this study show that the training accuracy of RF is 0.756 and the testing accuracy is 0.703. Similarly, the training accuracy of XGBoost is 0.757 and testing accuracy is 0.74. The prediction of DNN revealed acceptable agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing landslides, with a training accuracy of 0.855 and testing accuracy of 0.802.

Its natural environment has an important role in development. The unique and fragile ecosystem in the Yangtze River’s Three Gorges Reservoir region is prone to natural disasters, including soil erosion, landslides, debris flows, landslides, and earthquakes. Therefore, to better alleviate these threats, an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the susceptibility of this area is required. In this study, based on the collection of relevant data and existing research results, we applied machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), the random forest model (RF), and the support vector machine (SVM) model, to analyze landslide susceptibility in the Yangtze River’s Three Gorges Reservoir region to analyze landslide events in the whole study region. The models identified five categories (i.e., topographic, geological, ecological, meteorological, and human engineering activities), with nine independent variables, influencing landslide susceptibility. The accuracy of landslide susceptibility derived from different models and raster cells was then verified by the accuracy, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC of each model. The results illustrate that the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms is ranked as SVM &gt; RF &gt; LR. The LR model has the lowest generalization ability. The SVM model performs well in all regions of the study area, with an AUC value of 0.9708 for the entire Three Gorges Reservoir area, indicating that the SVM model possesses a strong spatial generalization ability as well as the highest robustness and can be adapted as a real-time model for assessing regional landslide susceptibility."

Satellite missions and field-based platforms have transformed understanding of the processes driving changes in mountain glacier dynamics, snow cover, lake evolution, and the associated emergence of hazards (e.g. avalanches, floods, landslides). Sensors and platforms are becoming more bespoke, with innovation being driven by the commercial sector, and image repositories are more frequently open access, leading to the democratisation of data analysis and interpretation. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are rapidly transforming our ability to handle this exponential increase in data. This review therefore provides a timely opportunity to synthesise current capabilities in remote sensing of the mountain cryosphere. Scientific and commercial applications were critically examined, recognising the technologies that have most advanced the discipline. Low-cost sensors can also be deployed in the field, using microprocessors and telecommunications equipment to connect mountain glaciers to stakeholders for real-time monitoring. The potential for novel automated pipelines that can process vast volumes of data is also discussed, from reimagining historical aerial imagery to produce elevation models, to automatically delineating glacier boundaries. Finally, the applications of these emerging techniques that will benefit scientific research avenues and real-world societal programmes are discussed."

In the domain of landslide risk science, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is very important, as it helps spatially identify potential landslide-prone regions. This study used a statistical ensemble model (frequency ratio and evidence belief function) and two machine learning (ML) models (random forest and XGBoost; eXtreme Gradient Boosting) for LSM in the province of Belluno (region of Veneto, northeastern Italy). The study investigated the importance of the conditioning factors in predicting landslide occurrences using the mentioned models. In this paper, we evaluated the importance of the conditioning factors in the overall prediction capabilities of the statistical and ML algorithms. By the trial-and-error method, we eliminated the least “important” features by using a common threshold of 0.30 for statistical and 0.03 for ML algorithms. Conclusively, we found that removing the least important features does not impact the overall accuracy of LSM for all three models. Based on the results of our study, the most commonly available features, for example, the topographic features, contributes to comparable results after removing the least important ones, namely the aspect plan and profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic roughness index (TRI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the case of the statistical model and the plan and profile curvature, TWI, and topographic position index (TPI) for ML algorithms. This confirms that the requirement for the important conditioning factor maps can be assessed based on the physiography of the region."

Remote sensing devices are becoming increasingly important in monitoring and assessing natural disaster susceptibility and hazards. The proposed research work pursues an assessment analysis of flood susceptibility in a tropical desert environment: a case study of Yemen. The base data for this research were collected and organized from meteorological, satellite images, remote sensing data, essential geographic data, and various data sources and used as input data into four machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this study, RS data (Sentinel-1 images) were used to detect flooded areas in the study area. We also used the Sentinel application platform (SNAP 7.0) for Sentinel-1 image analysis and detecting flood zones in the study locations. Flood spots were discovered and verified using Google Earth images, Landsat images, and press sources to create a flood inventory map of flooded areas in the study area. Four ML algorithms were used to map flash flood susceptibility (FFS) in Tarim city (Yemen): K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), random forests (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Twelve flood conditioning factors were prepared, assessed in multicollinearity, and used with flood inventories as input parameters to run each model. A total of 600 random flood and non-flood points were chosen, where 75% and 25% were used as training and validation datasets. The confusion matrix and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used to validate the susceptibility maps. The results obtained reveal that all models had a high capacity to predict floods (AUC &gt; 0.90). Further, in terms of performance, the tree-based ensemble algorithms (RF, XGBoost) outperform other ML algorithms, where the RF algorithm provides robust performance (AUC = 0.982) for assessing flood-prone areas with only a few adjustments required prior to training the model. The value of the research lies in the fact that the proposed models are being tested for the first time in Yemen to assess flood susceptibility, which can also be used to assess, for example, earthquakes, landslides, and other disasters. Furthermore, this work makes significant contributions to the worldwide effort to reduce the risk of natural disasters, particularly in Yemen. This will, therefore, help to enhance environmental sustainability."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Using Sparse Feature Extraction and Machine Learning Models Based on GIS and Remote Sensing,"Li Zhu, Gongjian Wang, Faming Huang, Yan Li, Wei Chen, Haoyuan Hong",2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/lgrs.2021.3054029,https://openalex.org/W3126772299,"Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) is a useful technology for landslide prevention. Due to the complex nonlinear correlations among environmental factors, traditional machine learning (ML) models have unsatisfactory LSP accuracies. In this letter, a sparse feature extraction network (SFE+) is proposed for LSP. First, the landslides and environmental factors are collected, and frequency ratios of environmental factors are calculated as the model inputs. Second, the input data are passed through the input layer with the dropout, and then, the features are passed through the hidden layers, that is, the k% lifetime sparsity layers. The hidden layers are employed to further sparse these factors to obtain the independent and redundant prediction features as much as possible. Finally, certain classifiers are used to realize the LSP in the study area. SFE-support vector machine (SVM), SFE-logistic regression (LR), and SFE-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models are built. For comparison, principal component analysis (PCA)-SVM, PCA-LR, PCA-SGD, SVM, LR, and SGD models are also built for LSP in Shicheng County, China. Results show that the SFE-based ML models, especially the SFE-SVM, can effectively extract the sparse nonlinear features of environmental factors to improve LSP accuracies and have promising prospects for LSP."

However, in most of the previous studies, the distribution of input data was assumed as being, and treated, as normal or Gaussian; this assumption is not always valid as ML is heavily dependent on the quality of the input data. Therefore, we examine the effectiveness of six feature transformations (minimax normalization (Std-X), logarithmic functions (Log-X), reciprocal function (Rec-X), power functions (Power-X), optimal features (Opt-X), and one-hot encoding (Ohe-X) over the 11conditioning factors (i.e., altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, distance to road, distance to lineament, distance to stream, terrain roughness index (TRI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, and vegetation density). We selected the frequent landslide-prone area in the Cameron Highlands in Malaysia as a case study to test this novel approach. These transformations were then assessed by three benchmark ML methods, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGB), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The 10-fold cross-validation method was used for model evaluations. Our results suggest that using Ohe-X transformation over the ANN model considerably improved performance from 52.244 to 89.398 (37.154% improvement)."

In recent years, deep learning has been successfully applied to landslide susceptibility assessment due to the strong ability of fitting. However, in actual applications, the number of labeled samples is usually not sufficient for the training component. In this paper, a deep neural network model based on semi-supervised learning (SSL-DNN) for landslide susceptibility is proposed, which makes full use of a large number of spatial information (unlabeled data) with limited labeled data in the region to train the mode. Taking Jiaohe County in Jilin Province, China as an example, the landslide inventory from 2000 to 2017 was collected and 12 metrological, geographical, and human explanatory factors were compiled. Meanwhile, supervised models such as deep neural network (DNN), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) were implemented for comparison. Then, the landslide susceptibility was plotted and a series of evaluation tools such as class accuracy, predictive rate curves (AUC), and information gain ratio (IGR) were calculated to compare the prediction of models and factors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SSL-DNN model (AUC = 0.898) outperformed all the comparison models. Therefore, semi-supervised deep learning could be considered as a potential approach for LSM."

Each year it causes fatalities, casualties and economic and social losses on large populated areas. Accurate short-term predictions of landslides can be extremely important and useful, in order to both provide local authorities with efficient prediction/early warning and increase the resilience to manage emergencies. There is an extensive literature addressing the problem of computing landslide susceptibility maps (which is a classification problem exploiting a large range of static features) and only few on actual short terms predictions (spatial and temporal). The short-term prediction models are still empirical and obtain unsatisfactory results, also in the identification of the predictors. The new aspects addressed in this paper are: (i) a short-term prediction model (1 day in advance) of landslide based on machine learning, (ii) real time features as good predictors. The introduction of explainable artificial intelligence techniques allowed to understand global and local feature relevance. In order to find the best prediction model, some machine learning solutions have been implemented and assessed. The obtained models overcome the ones available in literature. The validation has been performed in the context of the Metropolitan City of Florence, data from 2013 to 2019. The method based on XGBoost achieved best results, demonstrating that it is the most reliable and robust against false alarms. Finally, we applied explainable artificial intelligence techniques locally and globally to derive a deep understanding of the predictive model's outputs and features' relevance, and relationships. The analysis allowed us to identify the best feature for short term predictions and their impact in local cases and global prediction model.

Machine learning methods require the collection of both training and testing data to produce and evaluate the classification results. The collection of good quality landslide ground truths to train classifiers and detect landslides in other regions is a challenge, with a significant impact on classification accuracy. Taking this into account, the following research question arises: What is the appropriate training–testing dataset split ratio in supervised classification to effectively detect landslides in a testing area based on DEMs? We investigated this issue for both the pixel-based approach (PBA) and object-based image analysis (OBIA). In both approaches, the random forest (RF) classification was implemented. The experiments were performed in the most landslide-affected area in Poland in the Outer Carpathians-Rożnów Lake vicinity. Based on the accuracy assessment, we found that the training area should be of a similar size to the testing area. We also found that the OBIA approach performs slightly better than PBA when the quantity of training samples is significantly lower than the testing samples. To increase detection performance, the intersection of the OBIA and PBA results together with median filtering and the removal of small elongated objects were performed. This allowed an overall accuracy (OA) = 80% and F1 Score = 0.50 to be achieved. The achieved results are compared and discussed with other landslide detection-related studies."

EEMD and kurtosis criteria were first applied for data decomposition and construction of trend and periodic components. Second, a polynomial regression model and RNN with maximal information coefficient (MIC)-based input variable selection were implemented for individual prediction of trend and periodic components independently. Finally, the predictions of trend and periodic components were aggregated into a final ensemble prediction. The experimental results from the Muyubao landslide demonstrate that the proposed EEMD-RNN decomposition-ensemble learning model is capable of increasing prediction accuracy and outperforms the traditional decomposition-ensemble learning models (including EEMD-support vector machine, and EEMD-extreme learning machine). Moreover, compared with standard RNN, the gated recurrent unit (GRU)-and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based models perform better in predicting accuracy. The EEMD-RNN decomposition-ensemble learning model is promising for landslide displacement prediction."
A New Integrated Approach for Landslide Data Balancing and Spatial Prediction Based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN),"Husam A. H. Al-Najjar, Biswajeet Pradhan, Raju Sarkar, Ghassan Beydoun, Abdullah Alamri",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13194011,https://openalex.org/W3206337481,"Landslide susceptibility mapping has significantly progressed with improvements in machine learning techniques. However, the inventory/data imbalance (DI) problem remains one of the challenges in this domain. This problem exists as a good quality landslide inventory map, including a complete record of historical data, is difficult or expensive to collect. As such, this can considerably affect one’s ability to obtain a sufficient inventory or representative samples. This research developed a new approach based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) to correct imbalanced landslide datasets. The proposed method was tested at Chukha Dzongkhag, Bhutan, one of the most frequent landslide prone areas in the Himalayan region. The proposed approach was then compared with the standard methods such as the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), dense imbalanced sampling, and sparse sampling (i.e., producing non-landslide samples as many as landslide samples). The comparisons were based on five machine learning models, including artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), and the support vector machine (SVM). The model evaluation was carried out based on overall accuracy (OA), Kappa Index, F1-score, and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). The spatial database was established with a total of 269 landslides and 10 conditioning factors, including altitude, slope, aspect, total curvature, slope length, lithology, distance from the road, distance from the stream, topographic wetness index (TWI), and sediment transport index (STI). The findings of this study have shown that both GAN and SMOTE data balancing approaches have helped to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. According to AUROC, the GAN method was able to boost the models by reaching the maximum accuracy of ANN (0.918), RF (0.933), DT (0.927), kNN (0.878), and SVM (0.907) when default parameters used. With the optimum parameters, all models performed best with GAN at their highest accuracy of ANN (0.927), RF (0.943), DT (0.923) and kNN (0.889), except SVM obtained the highest accuracy of (0.906) with SMOTE. Our finding suggests that RF balanced with GAN can provide the most reasonable criterion for landslide prediction. This research indicates that landslide data balancing may substantially affect the predictive capabilities of machine learning models. Therefore, the issue of DI in the spatial prediction of landslides should not be ignored. Future studies could explore other generative models for landslide data balancing. By using state-of-the-art GAN, the proposed model can be considered in the areas where the data are limited or imbalanced."
Multi-hazard spatial modeling via ensembles of machine learning and meta-heuristic techniques,"Mojgan Bordbar, Hossein Aghamohammadi, Hamid Reza Pourghasemi, Zahra Azizi",2022,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05364-y,https://openalex.org/W4210516638,"Abstract Considering the large number of natural disasters on the planet, many areas in the world are at risk of these hazards; therefore, providing an integrated map as a guide map for multiple natural hazards can be applied to save human lives and reduce financial losses. This study designed a multi-hazard map for three important hazards (earthquakes, floods, and landslides) to identify endangered areas in Kermanshah province located in western Iran using ensemble SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO models. In the first step, flood and landslide inventory maps were generated to identify at-risk areas. Then, the occurrence places for each hazard were divided into two groups for training susceptibility models (70%) and testing the models applied (30%). Factors affecting these hazards, including altitude, slope aspect, slope degree, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to the faults, rainfall, lithology, and land use, were used to generate susceptibility maps. The SWARA method was used to weigh the subclasses of the influencing factors in floods and landslides. In addition, a peak ground acceleration (PGA) map was generated to investigate earthquakes in the study area. In the next step, the ANFIS machine learning algorithm was used in combination with PSO and GWO meta-heuristic algorithms to train the data, and SWARA-ANFIS-PSO and SWARA-ANFIS-GWO susceptibility maps were separately generated for flood and landslide hazards. The predictive ability of the implemented models was validated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE) methods. The results showed that the SWARA-ANFIS-PSO ensemble model had the best performance in generating flood susceptibility maps with ROC = 0.936, RMS = 0.346, and MSE = 0.120. Furthermore, this model showed excellent results (ROC = 0.894, RMS = 0.410, and MSE = 0.168) for generating a landslide map. Finally, the best maps and PGA map were combined, and a multi-hazard map (MHM) was obtained for Kermanshah Province. This map can be used by managers and planners as a practical guide for sustainable development."
Semi-automated regional classification of the style of activity of slow rock-slope deformations using PS InSAR and SqueeSAR velocity data,"Chiara Crippa, Elena Valbuzzi, Paolo Frattini, Giovanni B. Crosta, Margherita Cecilia Spreafico, Federico Agliardi",2021,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-021-01654-0,https://openalex.org/W3141269485,"Abstract Large slow rock-slope deformations, including deep-seated gravitational slope deformations and large landslides, are widespread in alpine environments. They develop over thousands of years by progressive failure, resulting in slow movements that impact infrastructures and can eventually evolve into catastrophic rockslides. A robust characterization of their style of activity is thus required in a risk management perspective. We combine an original inventory of slow rock-slope deformations with different PS-InSAR and SqueeSAR datasets to develop a novel, semi-automated approach to characterize and classify 208 slow rock-slope deformations in Lombardia (Italian Central Alps) based on their displacement rate, kinematics, heterogeneity and morphometric expression. Through a peak analysis of displacement rate distributions, we characterize the segmentation of mapped landslides and highlight the occurrence of nested sectors with differential activity and displacement rates. Combining 2D decomposition of InSAR velocity vectors and machine learning classification, we develop an automatic approach to characterize the kinematics of each landslide. Then, we sequentially combine principal component and K-medoids cluster analyses to identify groups of slow rock-slope deformations with consistent styles of activity. Our methodology is readily applicable to different landslide datasets and provides an objective and cost-effective support to land planning and the prioritization of local-scale studies aimed at granting safety and infrastructure integrity."

Most of existing works on landslide detection have limited geographical extents. Therefore, the models developed out of these studies might perform poorly when applied to regions with different characteristics. This study investigates an Object-Based Image Analysis methodology built on unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning to detect the location of landslides occurred in multiple regions across the world. The utilized data includes Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite imagery and ALOS Digital Elevation Model. In the segmentation stage, pre and post-landslide images undergo segmentation using K-means clustering. Following the segmentation stage and dataset preparation and removing highly-correlated features from the dataset, two Random Forest classifiers (RF1 and RF2) are trained and tested on two different datasets to measure the generalization level of the algorithms with RF1 dataset spanning over more geographical diversities than RF2 dataset. The results show that the RF models can successfully detect landslide segments with test precision = 0.96 and recall = 0.96 for RF1 and test precision = 0.90 and recall = 0.87 for RF2. Further validation shows that, compared to RF2, RF1 results in less mislabelled non-landslide segments."
Automated Landslide-Risk Prediction Using Web GIS and Machine Learning Models,"Naruephorn Tengtrairat, Wai Lok Woo, Phetcharat Parathai, Chuchoke Aryupong, Peerapong Jitsangiam, Damrongsak Rinchumphu",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21134620,https://openalex.org/W3182161388,"Spatial susceptible landslide prediction is the one of the most challenging research areas which essentially concerns the safety of inhabitants. The novel geographic information web (GIW) application is proposed for dynamically predicting landslide risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The automated GIW system is coordinated between machine learning technologies, web technologies, and application programming interfaces (APIs). The new bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) algorithm is presented to forecast landslides. The proposed algorithm consists of 3 major steps, the first of which is the construction of a landslide dataset by using Quantum GIS (QGIS). The second step is to generate the landslide-risk model based on machine learning approaches. Finally, the automated landslide-risk visualization illustrates the likelihood of landslide via Google Maps on the website. Four static factors are considered for landslide-risk prediction, namely, land cover, soil properties, elevation and slope, and a single dynamic factor i.e., precipitation. Data are collected to construct a geospatial landslide database which comprises three historical landslide locations—Phu Chifa at Thoeng District, Ban Pha Duea at Mae Salong Nai, and Mai Salong Nok in Mae Fa Luang District, Chiang Rai, Thailand. Data collection is achieved using QGIS software to interpolate contour, elevation, slope degree and land cover from the Google satellite images, aerial and site survey photographs while the physiographic and rock type are on-site surveyed by experts. The state-of-the-art machine learning models have been trained i.e., linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), LSTM, and Bi-LSTM. Ablation studies have been conducted to determine the optimal parameters setting for each model. An enhancement method based on two-stage classifications has been presented to improve the landslide prediction of LSTM and Bi-LSTM models. The landslide-risk prediction performances of these models are subsequently evaluated using real-time dataset and it is shown that Bi-LSTM with Random Forest (Bi-LSTM-RF) yields the best prediction performance. Bi-LSTM-RF model has improved the landslide-risk predicting performance over LR, ANNs, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM in terms of the area under the receiver characteristic operator (AUC) scores by 0.42, 0.27, 0.46, and 0.47, respectively. Finally, an automated web GIS has been developed and it consists of software components including the trained models, rainfall API, Google API, and geodatabase. All components have been interfaced together via JavaScript and Node.js tool."
A Meta-Learning Approach of Optimisation for Spatial Prediction of Landslides,"Biswajeet Pradhan, Maher Ibrahim Sameen, Husam A. H. Al-Najjar, Daichao Sheng, Abdullah Alamri, Hyuck‐Jin Park",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13224521,https://openalex.org/W3213078216,"Optimisation plays a key role in the application of machine learning in the spatial prediction of landslides. The common practice in optimising landslide prediction models is to search for optimal/suboptimal hyperparameter values in a number of predetermined hyperparameter configurations based on an objective function, i.e., k-fold cross-validation accuracy. However, the overhead of hyperparameter optimisation can be prohibitive, especially for computationally expensive algorithms. This paper introduces an optimisation approach based on meta-learning for the spatial prediction of landslides. The proposed approach is tested in a dense tropical forested area of Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. Instead of optimising prediction models with a large number of hyperparameter configurations, the proposed approach begins with promising configurations based on several basic and statistical meta-features. The proposed meta-learning approach was tested based on Bayesian optimisation as a hyperparameter tuning algorithm and random forest (RF) as a prediction model. The spatial database was established with a total of 63 historical landslides and 15 conditioning factors. Three RF models were constructed based on (1) default parameters as suggested by the sklearn library, (2) parameters suggested by the Bayesian optimisation (BO), and (3) parameters suggested by the proposed meta-learning approach (BO-ML). Based on five-fold cross-validation accuracy, the Bayesian method achieved the best performance for both the training (0.810) and test (0.802) datasets. The meta-learning approach achieved slightly lower accuracies than the Bayesian method for the training (0.769) and test (0.800) datasets. Similarly, based on F1-score and area under the receiving operating characteristic curves (AUROC), the models with optimised parameters either by the Bayesian or meta-learning methods produced more accurate landslide susceptibility assessment than the model with the default parameters. In the present approach, instead of learning from scratch, the meta-learning would begin with hyperparameter configurations optimal for the most similar previous datasets, which can be considerably helpful and time-saving for landslide modelings."
Machine learning for predicting landslide risk of Rohingya refugee camp infrastructure,"Nahian Ahmed, Adnan Firoze, Rashedur M.

The current largest population of stateless refugees in the world, the Rohingya people, reside in the southeastern border region of Bangladesh. Due to rapid expansion of refugee camps and lack of suitable locations, a large proportion of the infrastructure are at risk of landslides. This study aims to use machine learning for predicting landslide risk of camp infrastructure using geospatial features. Four supervised classification algorithms have been employed viz., (i) Logistic Regression (LR), (ii) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), (iii) Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) and (iv) Random Forest (RF) and applied on preprocessing varied versions of features. Results show that RF achieves accuracy of 76.19% and AUC of 0.76 on un-scaled features which is higher than all other algorithms. The applications of the study reside in refugee management and landslide susceptibility mapping of Rohingya camps, which can both potentially save refugee lives and serve as a case study for global applications."
Deformation Prediction of Unstable Slopes Based on Real-Time Monitoring and DeepAR Model,"Mei Dong, Hongyu Wu, Hui Hu, Rafig Azzam, Liang Zhang, Zengrong Zheng, Xiaonan Gong",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21010014,https://openalex.org/W3116760614,"With increased urbanization, accidents related to slope instability are frequently encountered in construction sites. The deformation and failure mechanism of a landslide is a complex dynamic process, which seriously threatens people’s lives and property. Currently, prediction and early warning of a landslide can be effectively performed by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the landslide deformation in real time and an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict the deformation trend. However, if a slope failure occurs during the construction period, the builders and decision-makers find it challenging to effectively apply IoT technology to monitor the emergency and assist in proposing treatment measures. Moreover, for projects during operation (e.g., a motorway in a mountainous area), no recognized artificial intelligence algorithm exists that can forecast the deformation of steep slopes using the huge data obtained from monitoring devices. In this context, this paper introduces a real-time wireless monitoring system with multiple sensors for retrieving high-frequency overall data that can describe the deformation feature of steep slopes. The system was installed in the Qili connecting line of a motorway in Zhejiang Province, China, to provide a technical support for the design and implementation of safety solutions for the steep slopes. Most of the devices were retained to monitor the slopes even after construction. The machine learning Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks (DeepAR) model based on time series and probabilistic forecasting was introduced into the project to predict the slope displacement. The predictive accuracy of the DeepAR model was verified by the mean absolute error, the root mean square error and the goodness of fit. This study demonstrates that the presented monitoring system and the introduced predictive model had good safety control ability during construction and good prediction accuracy during operation. The proposed approach will be helpful to assess the safety of excavated slopes before constructing new infrastructures."
Landslide Geometry Reveals its Trigger,"Kamal Rana, Uğur Öztürk, Nishant Malik",2021,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl090848,https://openalex.org/W3118822358,"Abstract Electronic databases of landslides seldom include the triggering mechanisms, rendering these inventories unusable for landslide hazard modeling. We present a method for classifying the triggering mechanisms of landslides in existing inventories, thus, allowing these inventories to aid in landslide hazard modeling corresponding to the correct event chain. Our method uses various geometric characteristics of landslides as the feature space for the machine‐learning classifier random forest , resulting in accurate and robust classifications of landslide triggers. We applied the method to six landslide inventories spread over the Japanese archipelago in several different tests and training configurations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We achieved mean accuracy ranging from 67% to 92%. We also provide an illustrative example of a real‐world usage scenario for our method using an additional inventory with unknown ground truth. Furthermore, our feature importance analysis indicates that landslides having identical trigger mechanisms exhibit similar geometric properties."

For this purpose, a total of 554 landslide locations and eleven influencing factors were integrated to construct a landslide susceptibility map. The landslide inventory data were separated into training and testing sets. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with other statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and accuracy, was applied to compare the performance of machine learning techniques. The results indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) value for the RF model (AUC=0.89) is high.Furthermore, our findings showed that the RF model performs the best among all the other models with the highest training and testing accuracy, 96% and 86%, respectively.

Active-Learning Approaches for Landslide Mapping Using Support Vector Machines,"Zhihao Wang, Alexander Brenning",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13132588,https://openalex.org/W3183934280,"Ex post landslide mapping for emergency response and ex ante landslide susceptibility modelling for hazard mitigation are two important application scenarios that require the development of accurate, yet cost-effective spatial landslide models. However, the manual labelling of instances for training machine learning models is time-consuming given the data requirements of flexible data-driven algorithms and the small percentage of area covered by landslides. Active learning aims to reduce labelling costs by selecting more informative instances. In this study, two common active-learning strategies, uncertainty sampling and query by committee, are combined with the support vector machine (SVM), a state-of-the-art machine-learning technique, in a landslide mapping case study in order to assess their possible benefits compared to simple random sampling of training locations. By selecting more “informative” instances, the SVMs with active learning based on uncertainty sampling outperformed both random sampling and query-by-committee strategies when considering mean AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) as performance measure. Uncertainty sampling also produced more stable performances with a smaller AUROC standard deviation across repetitions. In conclusion, under limited data conditions, uncertainty sampling reduces the amount of expert time needed by selecting more informative instances for SVM training. We therefore recommend incorporating active learning with uncertainty sampling into interactive landslide modelling workflows, especially in emergency response settings, but also in landslide susceptibility modelling."

Using a large training set and all predictor variables, an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.946 is obtained. Our findings highlight the value of a large training dataset, the incorporation of a variety of terrain variables and the use of variable window sizes to characterize the landscape at different spatial scales. We also document important variables for mapping slope failures. Our results suggest that feature selection is not required to improve the RF modeling results and that incorporating multiple models using different pseudo absence samples is not necessary. From our findings and based on a review of prior studies, we make recommendations for high spatial resolution, large-area slope failure probabilistic mapping."

PU-bagging deals with the lack of negative samples in a training set and uses only positive and unlabeled samples. We prove the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the PU-bagging decision tree (DT) generated landslide susceptibility map with the ground truth (known landslide locations), as well as by comparing its performance with three widely used models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network). The promising results and the fact that the method is general urge us to believe that the PU-bagging should be able to perform in other landslide-prone areas where only positive samples are provided."
Deep Learning as a Tool to Forecast Hydrologic Response for Landslide‐Prone Hillslopes,"Elijah Orland, Joshua J. Roering, Matthew A. Thomas, Benjamin B.

Although physically based hydrologic models can accurately simulate changes in soil moisture and pore pressure that promote landslides, their utility is restricted by high computational costs and nonunique parameterization issues. We construct a deep learning model using soil moisture, pore pressure, and rainfall monitoring data acquired from landslide‐prone hillslopes in Oregon, USA, to predict the timing and magnitude of hydrologic response at multiple soil depths for 36‐hr intervals. We find that observation records as short as 6 months are sufficient for accurate predictions, and our model captures hydrologic response for high‐intensity rainfall events even when those storm types are excluded from model training. We conclude that machine learning can provide an accurate and computationally efficient alternative to empirical methods or physical modeling for landslide hazard warning."

Kappa index, Accuracy (%) and ROC curve were employed to estimate the model’s performance and to test the outcomes provided by the models. Among the eleven machine learning algorithms, Random Sub Space Decision Table Naïve Bayes (RSSDTNB) was the most performant model with an AUC = 0.839, Accuracy = 76.55% and Kappa Index = 0.531.

Displacement Prediction of a Complex Landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (China) Using a Hybrid Computational Intelligence Approach,"Junwei Ma, Xiaoxu Niu, Huiming Tang, Yankun Wang, Tao Wen, Junrong Zhang",2020,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2624547,https://openalex.org/W3003220193,"Displacement prediction of reservoir landslide remains inherently uncertain since a complete understanding of the complex nonlinear, dynamic landslide system is still lacking. An appropriate quantification of predictive uncertainties is a key underpinning of displacement prediction and mitigation of reservoir landslide. A density prediction, offering a full estimation of the probability density for future outputs, is promising for quantification of the uncertainty of landslide displacement. In the present study, a hybrid computational intelligence approach is proposed to build a density prediction model of landslide displacement and quantify the associated predictive uncertainties. The hybrid computational intelligence approach consists of two steps: first, the input variables are selected through copula analysis; second, kernel-based support vector machine quantile regression (KSVMQR) is employed to perform density prediction. The copula-KSVMQR approach is demonstrated through a complex landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), China. The experimental study suggests that the copula-KSVMQR approach is capable of construction density prediction by providing full probability density distributions of the prediction with perfect performance. In addition, different types of predictions, including interval prediction and point prediction, can be derived from the obtained density predictions with excellent performance. The results show that the mean prediction interval widths of the proposed approach at ZG287 and ZG289 are 27.30 and 33.04, respectively, which are approximately 60 percent lower than that obtained using the traditional bootstrap-extreme learning machine-artificial neural network (Bootstrap-ELM-ANN). Moreover, the obtained point predictions show great consistency with the observations, with correlation coefficients of 0.9998. Given the satisfactory performance, the presented copula-KSVMQR approach shows a great ability to predict landslide displacement."

The statistical or machine learning methods for selecting DSM covariates are not available for those situations with limited samples. To solve the problem, this paper proposed a case-based method which could formalize the covariate selection knowledge contained in practical DSM applications. The proposed method trained Random Forest (RF) classifiers with DSM cases extracted from the practical DSM applications and then used the trained classifiers to determine whether each one potential covariate should be used in a new DSM application. In this study, we took topographic covariates as examples of covariates and extracted 191 DSM cases from 56 peer-reviewed journal articles to evaluate the performance of the proposed case-based method by Leave-One-Out cross validation. Compared with a novices' commonly-used way of selecting DSM covariates, the proposed case-based method improved more than 30% accuracy according to three quantitative evaluation indices (i.e., recall, precision, and F1-score). The proposed method could be also applied to selecting the proper set of covariates for other similar geographical modeling domains, such as landslide susceptibility mapping, and species distribution modeling."
Comparisons of Convolutional Neural Network and Other Machine Learning Methods in Landslide Susceptibility Assessment: A Case Study in Pingwu,"Ziyu Jiang, Ming Wang, Kai Liu",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15030798,https://openalex.org/W4318817650,"Landslide is a natural disaster that seriously affects human life and social development. In this study, the characteristics and effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) and conventional machine learning (ML) methods in a landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) are compared. Six ML methods used in this study are Adaboost, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN), random forest (RF), naive Bayes, decision tree (DT), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). First, the basic knowledge and structures of the CNN and ML methods, and the steps of the LSA are introduced. Then, 11 conditioning factors in three categories in the Hongxi River Basin, Pingwu County, Mianyang City, Sichuan Province are chosen to build the train, validation, and test samples. The CNN and ML models are constructed based on these samples. For comparison, indicator methods, statistical methods, and landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) are used. The result shows that the CNN can obtain the highest accuracy (86.41%) and the highest AUC (0.9249) in the LSA. The statistical methods represented by the mean and variance of TP and TN perform more firmly on the possibility of landslide occurrence. Furthermore, the LSMs show that all models can successfully identify most of the landslide points, but for areas with a low frequency of landslides, some models are insufficient. The CNN model demonstrates better results in the recognition of the landslides’ cluster region, this is also related to the convolution operation that takes the surrounding environment information into account. The higher accuracy and more concentrative possibility of CNN in LSA is of great significance for disaster prevention and mitigation, which can help the efficient use of human and material resources. Although CNN performs better than other methods, there are still some limitations, the identification of low-cluster landside areas can be enhanced by improving the CNN model."

The models are evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and three common performance metrics: sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The results indicate that the four ensemble models have an AUC of more than 0.8, suggesting that they can appropriately and accurately predict landslide susceptibility maps. In particular, the XGBoost model achieves the best performance among all models, having a sensitivity of 92.86, specificity of 90.00, and accuracy of 91.38. Furthermore, the bagging model has a sensitivity of 89.29, specificity of 86.67, and accuracy of 87.93, and it is superior to the GBDT, which achieves a sensitivity of 86.21, specificity of 86.21, and accuracy of 86.21, and the AB, reaching a sensitivity of 82.14, specificity of 80.00, and accuracy of 81.03. The results presented in this study indicate that the advanced ensemble model, the XGBoost model, could be a promising tool for the selection of ensemble models for predicting landslide susceptibility mapping."
Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Potential Active Landslide Hazards Identification with Multi-Source Data,"Xiangxiang Zheng, Guojin He, Shanshan Wang, Yi Wang, Guizhou Wang, Zhaoying Yang, Junchuan Yu, Ning Wang",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10040253,https://openalex.org/W3155967209,"The early identification of potential landslide hazards is of great practical significance for disaster early warning and prevention. The study used different machine learning methods to identify potential active landslides along a 15 km buffer zone on both sides of Jinsha River (Panzhihua-Huize section), China. The morphology and texture features of landslides were characterized with InSAR deformation monitoring data and high-resolution optical remote sensing data, combined with 17 landslide influencing factors. In the study area, 83 deformation accumulation areas of potential landslide hazards and 54 deformation accumulation areas of non-potential landslide hazards were identified through spatial overlay analysis with 64 potential active landslides, which have been confirmed by field verification. The Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were trained and tested through attribute selection and parameter optimization. Among the 17 landslide influencing factors, Drainage Density, NDVI, Slope and Weathering Degree play an indispensable role in the machine learning and recognition of landslide hazards in our study area, while other influencing factors play a certain role in different algorithms. A multi-index (Precision, Recall, F1) comparison shows that the SVM (0.867, 0.829, 0.816) has better recognition precision skill for small-scale unbalanced landslide deformation datasets, followed by RF (0.765, 0.756, 0.741), DT (0.755, 0.756, 0.748) and NB (0.659, 0.659, 0.659). Different from the previous study on landslide susceptibility and hazard mapping based on machine learning, this study focuses on how to find out the potential active landslide points more accurately, rather than evaluating the landslide susceptibility of specific areas to tell us which areas are more sensitive to landslides. This study verified the feasibility of early identification of landslide hazards by using different machine learning methods combined with deformation information and multi-source landslide influencing factors rather than by relying on human–computer interaction. This study shows that the efficiency of potential hazard identification can be increased while reducing the subjective bias caused by relying only on human experts."
Large-Scale Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using an Integrated Machine Learning Model: A Case Study in the Lvliang Mountains of China,"Yin Xing, Jianping Yue, Zizheng Guo, Chen Yang, Jia Hu, Anna Travé",2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.722491,https://openalex.org/W3195116816,"Integration of different models may improve the performance of landslide susceptibility assessment, but few studies have tested it. The present study aims at exploring the way to integrating different models and comparing the results among integrated and individual models. Our objective is to answer this question: Will the integrated model have higher accuracy compared with individual model? The Lvliang mountains area, a landslide-prone area in China, was taken as the study area, and ten factors were considered in the influencing factors system. Three basic machine learning models (the back propagation (BP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) models) were integrated by an objective function where the weight coefficients among different models were computed by the gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. 80 and 20% of the landslide data were randomly selected as the training and testing samples, respectively, and different landslide susceptibility maps were generated based on the GIS platform. The results illustrated that the accuracy expressed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the BP-SVM-RF integrated model was the highest (0.7898), which was better than that of the BP (0.6929), SVM (0.6582), RF (0.7258), BP-SVM (0.7360), BP-RF (0.7569), and SVM-RF models (0.7298). The experimental results authenticated the effectiveness of the BP-SVM-RF method, which can be a reliable model for the regional landslide susceptibility assessment of the study area. Moreover, the proposed procedure can be a good option to integrate different models to seek an “optimal” result."

The data showed that every year, around 400 fatalities occur in Himalayan terrain due to landslide. In the current study, we have mapped the landslide susceptibility zones in the segment of Garhwal Himalaya using robust machine and deep learning algorithms. Individual machine and deep learning models have its own limitations like low generation capacity with nonlinear functions to describe the intricate relationship among predictors. In this study total five models i.e., SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), bagging, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), DLNN (Deep Learning Neural Network) have been used along with twenty landslide controlling factors. Here, the principal objective of the study is to precisely delineate landslide susceptibility zones of the Garhwal Himalaya. The selecting factors have been considered through multi-collinearity test and information gain ratio statistics and the previous landslide points have been taken as training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset. According to area under curve value (AUC), the DLNN technique has high capability (AUC = 0.925) and accuracy for landslide area demarcation. The approach of integrated physical and social factors creates more precise prediction aptitude that can support large scale landslide management. These high precision models identified most of the parts of Rudraprayag and Tehri Garhwal as a very high landslide susceptibility zone. The generated maps can assist to policy makers for micro scale landslide management and sustainable land use planning particularly in Himalayan terrain."

Predicting landslides along the KKH is challenging due to limitations in techniques, a challenging environment, and data availability issues. This study uses machine learning (ML) models and a landslide inventory to evaluate the relationship between landslide events and their causative factors. For this, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models were used. A total of 303 landslide points were used to create an inventory, with 70% for training and 30% for testing. Susceptibility mapping used Fourteen landslide causative factors. The area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is employed to compare the accuracy of the models. The deformation of generated models in susceptible regions was evaluated using SBAS-InSAR (Small-Baseline subset-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technique. The sensitive regions of the models showed elevated line-of-sight (LOS) deformation velocity. The XGBoost technique produces a superior Landslide Susceptibility map (LSM) for the region with the integration of SBAS-InSAR findings. This improved LSM offers predictive modeling for disaster mitigation and gives a theoretical direction for the regular management of KKH."

It passes through extremely steep slopes and high mountains prone to mass movements, particularly landslides and rockslides. Most mountainous roads are constructed on fragile and rocky slopes, and any natural (e.g., precipitation) or human-triggered disturbance (e.g., heavy traffic) can cause a fatal and devastating landslide under the influence of gravity. Many landslide-prone sites along the Highway are responsible for the continuous blockade almost throughout the year but peaking particularly during winters. As a result, it has a high toll on the state's economy and is responsible for many human casualties yearly. The present study aims to characterize various factors and their threshold values responsible for triggering a landslide. Through extensive field surveys, we evaluated different geotechnical parameters of soils at the most landslide-prone site along the Highway and augmented it with the satellite remote sensing datasets to determine the threshold values that trigger a landslide and assess the probability of occurrence of landslide events in the future using Autoregressive Moving Average (ARIMA) model and IBM SPSS Forecasting Model.

Monthly Rainfall Prediction Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms for Early Warning of Landslide Occurrence,"Shikha Srivastava, Nishchay Anand, Sumit Sharma, Sunil Dhar, Lokesh Kumar Sinha",2020,https://doi.org/10.1109/incet49848.2020.9154184,https://openalex.org/W3047450523,"Landslides are considered to be calamitous natural hazards commonly recurring in the Indian Himalayas. Majority of landslides are induced by prolonged or heavy rainfall. Rainfall forecasting helps in identifying the precipitation conditions responsible for landslide occurrence. The proposed research work provides the performance comparison of various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR) and long short term memory network (LSTM) used to forecast rainfall which can be compared with the rainfall thresholds to predict landslide occurrence. The analysis is performed using antecedent rainfall data obtained from Narendra Nagar, a small town in the Tehri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand for the period of 1901-2015. Owing to the limited predictability of instantaneous state of the weather, daily rainfall observations are aggregated into monthly indexes. The proposed algorithms use preprocessing techniques followed by data normalization to increase the accuracy of forecasting models. The developed models have the ability to predict rainfall intensity one month in advance or for a specific month of the upcoming year depending upon the dataset used. The study concludes that the BPNNs are able to outperform and provide optimal inferences stating the aptness of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in estimating rainfall and hence predicting the possibility of landslide occurrence well in advance. The study is conducted explicitly for regions highly vulnerable to landslides near Narendra Nagar but may be implemented to any landslide prone area."
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Based on Interpretable Machine Learning from the Perspective of Geomorphological Differentiation,"Deliang Sun, D C Chen, Jialan Zhang, Changlin Mi, Qingyu Gu, Haijia Wen",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/land12051018,https://openalex.org/W4381927585,"(1) Background: The aim of this paper was to study landslide susceptibility mapping based on interpretable machine learning from the perspective of topography differentiation. (2) Methods: This paper selects three counties (Chengkou, Wushan and Wuxi counties) in northeastern Chongqing, delineated as the corrosion layered high and middle mountain region (Zone I), and three counties (Wulong, Pengshui and Shizhu counties) in southeastern Chongqing, delineated as the middle mountainous region of strong karst gorges (Zone II), as the study area. This study used a Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of the LightGBM and XGBoost models and construct evaluation models for each of the two regions. The model with high accuracy was selected according to the accuracy of the evaluation indicators in order to establish the landslide susceptibility mapping. The SHAP algorithm was then used to explore the landslide formation mechanisms of different landforms from both a global and local perspective. (3) Results: The AUC values for the test set in the LightGBM mode for Zones I and II are 0.8525 and 0.8859, respectively, and those for the test set in the XGBoost model are 0.8214 and 0.8375, respectively. This shows that LightGBM has a high prediction accuracy with regard to both landforms. Under the two different landform types, the elevation, land use, incision depth, distance from road and the average annual rainfall were the common dominant factors contributing most to decision making at both sites; the distance from a fault and the distance from the river have different degrees of influence under different landform types. (4) Conclusions: the optimized LightGBM-SHAP model is suitable for the analysis of landslide susceptibility in two types of landscapes, namely the corrosion layered high and middle mountain region, and the middle mountainous region of strong karst gorges, and can be used to explore the internal decision-making mechanism of the model at both the global and local levels, which makes the landslide susceptibility prediction results more realistic and transparent. This is beneficial to the selection of a landslide susceptibility index system and the early prevention and control of landslide hazards, and can provide a reference for the prediction of potential landslide hazard-prone areas and interpretable machine learning research."

A robust set of landslide inventories are needed to effectively train the machine learning‐based LHASA‐Mekong model. In this study, the Semi‐Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system was modified by incorporating a change detection module (SALaD‐CD) to produce rainfall event‐based landslide inventories using pre‐ and post‐imagery from RapidEye and PlanetScope for various locations in the LMR that were identified based on media and government reports. These rainfall‐induced landslides are published as initiation points for ease of use. In total, we created 22 inventories: 2 in Laos, 4 in Myanmar, 1 in Thailand and 15 in Vietnam. These inventories are being used to train the LHASA‐Mekong model and quantify the effects of Land use/Land cover change on landslide susceptibility.

Therefore, four advanced machine learning models, namely, the Bayesian network (BN), decision table (DTable), radial basis function network (RBFN), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), are proposed in this study to delineate landslide susceptibility zones. First, a landslide inventory map was randomly divided into 828 (75%) samples and 276 (25%) samples for training and validation, respectively. Second, the One-R technique was utilized to analyze the importance of 14 variables. Then, the prediction capability of the four models was validated and compared in terms of different statistical indices (accuracy (ACC) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (k)) and the areas under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that the SGD model performed best (AUC = 0.897, ACC = 80.98%, and k = 0.62), followed by the BN (AUC = 0.863, ACC = 78.80%, and k = 0.58), RBFN (AUC = 0.846, ACC = 77.36%, and k = 0.55), and DTable (AUC = 0.843, ACC = 76.45%, and k = 0.53) models.

The historical satellite imageries are used to generate spatiotemporal landslide inventories of year 2005, 2007 and 2012. A spatial database was created pertaining to topographic, environmental, geologic, and anthropogenic factors including slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, plane curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, distance to faults, distance to streams, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use/ land cover (LULC).

Two ML models, i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) were applied to assess landslide susceptibility determine by thirteen landslide causative factors (LCFs). The spatiotemporal landslide inventory was partitioned into training (70%) and testing (30%) landslides for respective years to check the prediction accuracies of selected ML models. Comparative analysis of different LSMs was performed by the Receiver Operator Curves – Area Under Curves (ROC-AUC). The resultant accuracy, MAE, RMSE, Kappa, Precision, Recall, F1 indicated that RF outperformed the LR model. The study aims to minimize losses to lives and potential economic damage linked with recurrent slope instabilities in the region.

However, the non-landslide samples cannot be directly obtained. In this study, a pattern-based approach is proposed to improve the LSM process, constructing unsupervised machine learning (UML) – supervised machine learning (SML) collaborative models in which the non-landslide samples can be reasonably selected. Two UML models, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and K-means, are introduced to sample the non-landslide datasets with four sampling selections (abbreviated as A, B, C and D, respectively). Then non-landslide patterns recognised by the UML models are learned by the random forest (RF). A new sensitivity index, accuracy improvement ratio (AIR), is defined to evaluate the superiority of these sampling selections. Compared with the GMM-RF model, the K-means-RF model is more capable of recognising non-landslide patterns and providing sufficient and reliable non-landslide samples. The sampling selection A of the K-means-RF with an AIR value of 2.3 is regarded as the best selection. The results indicate that the UML-SML model based on the pattern-based approach offers an effective strategy to find the non-landslide samples and has a better solution to the LSM."

This study aims to combine qualitative and quantitative analysis and examine its effect on mapping accuracy; based on the feature importance ranks and the related literature, the key features for identifying landslide/non-landslide points of different sub-zones were further analyzed. Before modeling, the study area Yunyang County, Chongqing City, China, was manually divided into four sub-zones based on the information from geological hazards exploration in Chongqing, including the mechanism of landslide formation and sliding failure and geomorphic unit characteristics. Upon the qualitative analysis basis, five grid searches tuned random forest models (one for the whole region and four for the sub-zones independently) were established by 1654 data points and 20 conditioning features. Compared with the conventional data-driven method, the integrated quantitative evaluation based on the qualitative analysis results showed higher reliability, which not only improved the mapping accuracy but also increased the AUC values of all four sub-models, which were 8.8%, 2.3%, 1.9% and 9.1% higher than that of the parent model. Moreover, the quantitative evaluation based on the qualitative analysis revealed the key factors affecting local landslide formation. Therefore, qualitative analysis is recommended in future landslide susceptibility modeling with the additional combination of data-driven methods."
Landslide Susceptibility Modeling Using Remote Sensing Data and Random SubSpace-Based Functional Tree Classifier,"Tao Peng, Yunzhi Chen, Wei Chen",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14194803,https://openalex.org/W4297549386,"In this study, a random subspace-based function tree (RSFT) was developed for landslide susceptibility modeling, and by comparing with a bagging-based function tree (BFT), classification regression tree (CART), and Naïve-Bayes tree (NBTree) Classifier, to judge the performance difference between the hybrid model and the single models. In the first step, according to the characteristics of the geological environment and previous literature, 12 landslide conditioning factors were selected, including aspect, slope, profile curvature, plan curvature, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, soil, distance to river and distance to the road. Secondly, 328 historical landslides were randomly divided into a training group and a validation group in a ratio of 70/30, and the important analysis of landslide points and conditional factors was carried out using the functional tree (FT) model. In the third step, all data are loaded into FT, RSFT, BFT, CART, and NBTree models for the generation of landslide susceptibility maps (LSM). Comparisons were made by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to determine efficiency and effectiveness. According to the verification results, the five models selected this time all perform reasonably, but the RSFT model has the highest prediction rate (AUC = 0.838), which is better than the other three single machine learning models. The results of this study also demonstrated that the hybrid model generally improves the predictive power of the benchmark landslide susceptibility models."
Geohazards Susceptibility Assessment along the Upper Indus Basin Using Four Machine Learning and Statistical Models,"Hilal Ahmad, Chen Ningsheng, Mahfuzur Rahman, Md Monirul Islam, Hamid Reza Pourghasemi, Syed Fahad Hussain, Jules Maurice Habumugisha, Enlong Liu, Zheng Han, Huayong Ni, Ashraf Dewan",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10050315,https://openalex.org/W3157949276,"The China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project passes through the Karakoram Highway in northern Pakistan, which is one of the most hazardous regions of the world. The most common hazards in this region are landslides and debris flows, which result in loss of life and severe infrastructure damage every year. This study assessed geohazards (landslides and debris flows) and developed susceptibility maps by considering four standalone machine-learning and statistical approaches, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Shannon Entropy (SE), Weights-of-Evidence (WoE), and Frequency Ratio (FR) models. To this end, geohazard inventories were prepared using remote sensing techniques with field observations and historical hazard datasets. The spatial relationship of thirteen conditioning factors, namely, slope (degree), distance to faults, geology, elevation, distance to rivers, slope aspect, distance to road, annual mean rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, profile curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, and land cover, with hazard distribution was analyzed. The results showed that faults, slope angles, elevation, lithology, land cover, and mean annual rainfall play a key role in controlling the spatial distribution of geohazards in the study area. The final susceptibility maps were validated against ground truth points and by plotting Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves. According to the AUROC curves, the success rates of the LR, WoE, FR, and SE models were 85.30%, 76.00, 74.60%, and 71.40%, and their prediction rates were 83.10%, 75.00%, 73.50%, and 70.10%, respectively; these values show higher performance of LR over the other three models. Furthermore, 11.19%, 9.24%, 10.18%, 39.14%, and 30.25% of the areas corresponded to classes of very-high, high, moderate, low, and very-low susceptibility, respectively. The developed geohazard susceptibility map can be used by relevant government officials for the smooth implementation of the CPEC project at the regional scale."
Shallow landslide susceptibility mapping: A comparison between classification and regression tree and reduced error pruning tree algorithms,"Bahareh Ghasemain, Dawod Talebpoor Asl, Binh Thai Pham, Mohammadtghi Avand, Huu Duy Nguyen, Saeid Janizadeh",2020,https://doi.org/10.15625/0866-7187/42/3/14952,https://openalex.org/W3037626580,"Shallow landslides through land degrading not only lead to threat the properly and life of human but they also may produce huge ecosystem damages. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of two decision tree machine learning algorithms including classification and regression tree (CART) and reduced error pruning tree (REPTree) for shallow landslide susceptibility mapping in Bijar, Kurdistan province, Iran. We first used 20 conditioning factors and then they were tested by information gain ratio (IGR) technique to select the most important ones. We then constructed a geodatabase based on the selected factors along with a total of 111 landslide locations with a ratio of 80/20 (for calibration/validation). The performance of the models was checked by the true positive rate (TP Rate), false positive rate (FP Rate), precision, recall, F1-Measure, Kappa, mean absolute error, and area under the receiver operatic curve (AUC). Results of IGR specified that the slope angle and TWI had the most contribution to shallow landslide occurrence in the study area. Moreover, results concluded that although these models had a high goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, the CART model (AUC=0.856) outperformed the REPTree model (AUC=0.837). Therefore, the CART model can be used as a promising tool and also as a base classifier to hybrid with optimization algorithms and Meta classifiers for spatial prediction of shallow landslide-prone areas."

A critical step in managing landslide risks is to predict the time, locations and consequences of slope failures in future rainstorms. Based on comprehensive databases of in-service man-made slopes, rainstorms and landslides in Hong Kong during the past 35 years, a spatio-temporal landslide forecasting model for man-made slopes is developed in this study within a unified machine learning framework. With a storm-based data integration strategy and multiclass classification on landslide scales, the framework incorporates landslide time and consequences in landslide susceptibility mapping to successfully achieve spatio-temporal landslide forecasting. The machine learning-based landslide forecasting model is validated against historical landslide incidents both temporally and spatially and through a case study of the June 2008 storm; the model significantly outperforms the prevailing statistical rainfall–landslide correlations in terms of prediction accuracy. The model can predict the real-time evolution of probabilities, scales and spatial distribution of landslides during the progression of a rainstorm, which can never be achieved by statistical methods. It can serve as an essential module for state-of-the-art landslide risk assessment and early warning."

However, few reports are available that address the geological hazard susceptibility of the region. This study developed six machine learning models to assess the geological hazard susceptibility. The results show that areas with medium and high susceptibility to geological hazards as a whole account for almost 21% of the total area, while both are 18% when it comes to the single hazard of landslide and rockfall respectively. Medium and high geological hazard susceptibility is found in three parts of the HMR with different characteristics: (1) the central and southern parts, where the population of the region concentrates; (2) the northern part, where higher geological hazard susceptibility is found along the mountain ranges; and (3) the junction of Tibet, Yunnan, and Sichuan in the eastern part, which is prone to larger-scale geological hazards. Of all the potential influencing factors, topographic features and climatic variables act as the major driving factors behind geological hazards and elevation, slope, and precipitation are crucial indicators for geological hazard susceptibility assessment. This study developed the geological hazard susceptibility maps of the HMR and provided information for the multi-hazard risk assessment and management of the region."
Accurate Prediction of Earthquake-Induced Landslides Based on Deep Learning Considering Landslide Source Area,"Yao Li, Peng Cui, Chengming Ye, José Marcato, Zhengtao Zhang, Jian Guo, Jonathan Li",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13173436,https://openalex.org/W3197879980,"An earthquake-induced landslide (EQIL) is a rapidly changing process occurring at the Earth’s surface that is strongly controlled by the earthquake in question and predisposing conditions. Predicting locations prone to EQILs on a large scale is significant for managing rescue operations and disaster mitigation. We propose a deep learning framework while considering the source area feature of EQIL to model the complex relationship and enhance spatial prediction accuracy. Initially, we used high-resolution remote sensing images and a digital elevation model (DEM) to extract the source area of an EQIL. Then, 14 controlling factors were input to a stacked autoencoder (SAE) to search for robust features by sparse optimization, and the classifier took advantage of high-level abstract features to identify the EQIL spatially. Finally, the EQIL inventory collected from the Wenchuan earthquake was used to validate the proposed model. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperformed conventional methods, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.88%, while logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) achieved 80.75%, 82.22%, and 84.16%, respectively. Meanwhile, this study reveals that shallow machine learning models only take advantage of significant factors for EQIL prediction, but deep learning models can extract more effective information related to EQIL distribution from low-value density data, which is why its prediction accuracy is growing with increasing input factors. There is hope that new knowledge of EQILs can be represented by high-level abstract features extracted by hidden layers of the deep learning model, which are typically acquired by statistical methods."
Understanding and Consideration of Related Issues in Early Identification of Potential Geohazards,Qiang Xu,2020,https://doi.org/10.13203/j.whugis20200043,https://openalex.org/W3149991894,"Objectives  In China, geohazards are wide-ranging. Traditional artificial investigations have found nearly three hundred thousand locations of potential geohazards. However, the recent occurred catastrophic geohazards are not within these determined locations. Widely identification of potential geohazards become one of the most important jobs for geohazard prevention and mitigation.   Methods  We propose some suggestions to promote early identification for potential geohazards.   Results  (1) Recently, various remote sensing techniques play an significant role in geohazard identification, but each technique has its limitation to recognize geohazards with different types and characteristics. Only integrated technologies, mutual complementation and verification, can effectively solve the problem. (2) Combination between traditional geological surveys and modern technologies (LiDAR, aerial and semi-aerial geophysical exploration, etc.) can improve the efficiency and accuracy for identification of the most difficult and unstable slops.(3) The deep machine learning is expected to realize the intelligent automatic identification of geohazards. Currently, it shows good performance in new geohazards with significant spectral and texture characteristics, while the accuracy of automatic identification for other types, such as ancient landslides and normal potential geohazards, is still not enough.

A historical landslide inventory and 24 different landslide influencing factors (LIFs) were prepared using remotely sensed and auxiliary datasets. The LIFs were evaluated using multi-collinearity statistics and their relative importance was measured to select the most discriminative LIFs using the ensemble feature selection method, which was developed using Chi-square, gain ratio, and relief-F methods. We evaluated the performance of ten different ML algorithms (linear discriminant analysis, mixture discriminant analysis, bagged cart, boosted logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest, rotation forest, and C5.0) using different accuracy statistics (sensitivity, specificity, area under curve (AUC), and overall accuracy (OA)). We used suitable combinations of individual ML models to develop different ensemble ML models and evaluated their performance in LSM. We assessed the impact of LIFs on ML performance. Among all individual ML models, the k-nearest neighbors (sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.82, AUC = 0.86, OA = 78%) and artificial neural network (sensitivity = 0.71, specificity = 0.85, AUC = 0.87, OA = 79%) algorithms showed the best performance using the top five LIFs, while random forest, rotation forest, and C5.0 (sensitivity = 0.76–0.81, specificity = 0.87, AUC = 0.90–0.93, OA = 82–84%) outperformed other models when developed using all twenty-four LIFs. Among ensemble models, the ensemble of k-nearest neighbors and rotation forest, k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural network, and artificial neural network and rotation forest outperformed other models (sensitivity = 0.72–0.73, specificity = 0.83–0.84, AUC = 0.86, OA = 79%) using the top five LIFs. The landslide susceptibility maps derived using these models indicate that ~2–3% and ~10–12% of the total study area fall within the “very high” and “high” susceptibility. The obtained susceptibility maps can be efficiently used to prioritize landslide mitigation activities."

Past SLTs reached runup heights of up to 524 m and are responsible, in combination with associated phenomena and tsunamis generated by partially submerged landslides, for a cumulative death toll in excess of 58000. Generic experimental research into SLTs, i.e. studies intended to predict SLTs for a range of scenarios, is ongoing for many decades. However, the advancement in the physical understanding, the wave prediction accuracy between similar studies and the reliability of hazard assessments does not fully reflect the large number of published generic peer-review work, particularly after 2005. A step change in generic SLT research is therefore needed. This article critically reviews SLT research with a focus on generic empirical equations from laboratory and numerical tests. Key features of past SLT cases are presented, relevant parameters affecting SLTs are reviewed and the most relevant conditions of 76 studies involving 6481 experiments, are listed including 10 milestone studies. This article further reviews findings into the effects of the mass movement type and slide model, slide to wave energy transfer, wave types, the effects of the water body geometry and non-uniform bathymetry, frequency domain analysis, edge waves and analytic achievements. Research gaps and shortcomings around generic empirical equations are also highlighted. Options to contribute to a step change are then suggested. These include the Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations, a generally applicable numerical code, machine learning and combinations."
Suggestion for a new deterministic model coupled with machine learning techniques for landslide susceptibility mapping,"Dae-Hong Min, Hyung‐Koo Yoon",2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86137-x,https://openalex.org/W3139053027,"Deterministic models have been widely applied in landslide risk assessment (LRA), but they have limitations in obtaining various geotechnical and hydraulic properties. The objective of this study is to suggest a new deterministic method based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. Eight crucial variables of LRA are selected with reference to expert opinions, and the output value is set to the safety factor derived by Mohr-Coulomb failure theory in infinite slope. Linear regression and a neural network based on ML are applied to find the best model between independent and dependent variables. To increase the reliability of linear regression and the neural network, the results of back propagation, including gradient descent, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), and Bayesian regularization (BR) methods, are compared. An 1800-item dataset is constructed through measured data and artificial data by using a geostatistical technique, which can provide the information of an unknown area based on measured data. The results of linear regression and the neural network show that the special LM and BR back propagation methods demonstrate a high determination of coefficient. The important variables are also investigated though random forest (RF) to overcome the number of various input variables. Only four variables-shear strength, soil thickness, elastic modulus, and fine content-demonstrate a high reliability for LRA. The results show that it is possible to perform LRA with ML, and four variables are enough when it is difficult to obtain various variables."
Landslide susceptibility assessment using feature selection-based machine learning models,"Leilei Liu, Can Yang, Xiaomi Wang",2021,https://doi.org/10.12989/gae.2021.25.1.001,https://openalex.org/W3153886279,"Machine learning models have been widely used for landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) in recent years. The large number of inputs or conditioning factors for these models, however, can reduce the computation efficiency and increase the difficulty in collecting data. Feature selection is a good tool to address this problem by selecting the most important features among all factors to reduce the size of the input variables. However, two important questions need to be solved: (1) how do feature selection methods affect the performance of machine learning models? and (2) which feature selection method is the most suitable for a given machine learning model? This paper aims to address these two questions by comparing the predictive performance of 13 feature selection-based machine learning (FS-ML) models and 5 ordinary machine learning models on LSA. First, five commonly used machine learning models (i.e., logistic regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, Gaussian process and random forest) and six typical feature selection methods in the literature are adopted to constitute the proposed models. Then, fifteen conditioning factors are chosen as input variables and 1,017 landslides are used as recorded data. Next, feature selection methods are used to obtain the importance of the conditioning factors to create feature subsets, based on which 13 FS-ML models are constructed. For each of the machine learning models, a best optimized FS-ML model is selected according to the area under curve value. Finally, five optimal FS-ML models are obtained and applied to the LSA of the studied area. The predictive abilities of the FS-ML models on LSA are verified and compared through the receive operating characteristic curve and statistical indicators such as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The results showed that different feature selection methods have different effects on the performance of LSA machine learning models. FS-ML models generally outperform the ordinary machine learning models. The best FS-ML model is the recursive feature elimination (RFE) optimized RF, and RFE is an optimal method for feature selection."

Among these contributors, approximately half of the inflow is attributed to the Zarrineh River and the Simineh River. Remarkably, Lake Urmia lacks a natural outlet, with its water loss occurring solely through evaporation processes. This study employed a comprehensive methodology integrating ground surveys, remote sensing analyses, and meticulous documentation of historical landslides within the basin as primary information sources. Through this investigative approach, we preciselyidentified and geolocated a total of 512 historical landslide occurrences across the Urmia Lake drainage basin, leveraging GPS technology for precision. Thisarticle introduces a suite of hybrid machine learning predictive models, such as support-vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), logistic regression (LR), fuzzy logic (FL), and the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS). These models were strategically deployed to assess landslide susceptibility within the region. The outcomes of the landslide susceptibility assessment reveal that the main high susceptible zones for landslide occurrence are concentrated in the northwestern, northern, northeastern, and some southern and southeastern areas of the region. Moreover, when considering the implementation of predictions using different algorithms, it became evident that SVM exhibited superior performance regardingboth accuracy (0.89) and precision (0.89), followed by RF, with and accuracy of 0.83 and a precision of 0.83. However, it is noteworthy that TOPSIS yielded the lowest accuracy value among the algorithms assessed."

The results demonstrated that the combined approach improves prediction accuracy and reduces the false negative and false positive errors. The LR-InSAR model showed the best performance in dynamic landslide susceptibility assessment at both regional and smaller scale, particularly when identifying areas of high and very high susceptibility. Modeling results were verified using data from field investigations including unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights.

Uncertainties of landslide susceptibility prediction: Influences of random errors in landslide conditioning factors and errors reduction by low pass filter method,"Faming Huang, Zuokui Teng, Chi Yao, Shui‐Hua Jiang, Filippo Catani, Wei Chen, Jinsong Huang",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2023.11.001,https://openalex.org/W4388821674,"In the existing landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) models, the influences of random errors in landslide conditioning factors on LSP are not considered, instead the original conditioning factors are directly taken as the model inputs, which brings uncertainties to LSP results. This study aims to reveal the influence rules of the different proportional random errors in conditioning factors on the LSP uncertainties, and further explore a method which can effectively reduce the random errors in conditioning factors. The original conditioning factors are firstly used to construct original factors-based LSP models, and then different random errors of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% are added to these original factors for constructing relevant errors-based LSP models. Secondly, low-pass filter-based LSP models are constructed by eliminating the random errors using low-pass filter method. Thirdly, the Ruijin County of China with 370 landslides and 16 conditioning factors are used as study case. Three typical machine learning models, i.e. multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), are selected as LSP models. Finally, the LSP uncertainties are discussed and results show that: (1) The low-pass filter can effectively reduce the random errors in conditioning factors to decrease the LSP uncertainties. (2) With the proportions of random errors increasing from 5% to 20%, the LSP uncertainty increases continuously. (3) The original factors-based models are feasible for LSP in the absence of more accurate conditioning factors. (4) The influence degrees of two uncertainty issues, machine learning models and different proportions of random errors, on the LSP modeling are large and basically the same. (5) The Shapley values effectively explain the internal mechanism of machine learning model predicting landslide susceptibility. In conclusion, greater proportion of random errors in conditioning factors results in higher LSP uncertainty, and low-pass filter can effectively reduce these random errors."

As one of the deadliest types of disasters worldwide, they have a high death toll every year and cause a large amount of economic damage. The transition between urban and rural areas is characterized by highways, which, in rugged Himalayan terrain, have to be constructed by cutting into the mountains, thereby destabilizing them and making them prone to landslides. This study was conducted landslide-prone regions of the entire Himalayan belt, i.e., National Highway NH-44 (the Jammu–Srinagar stretch). The main objectives of this study are to understand the causes behind the regular recurrence of the landslides in this region and propose a landslide early warning system (LEWS) based on the most suitable machine learning algorithms among the four selected, i.e., multiple linear regression, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), random forest, and decision tree. It was found that ANFIS and random forest outperformed the other proposed methods with a substantial increase in overall accuracy. The LEWS model was developed using the land system parameters that govern landslide occurrence, such as rainfall, soil moisture, distance to the road and river, slope, land surface temperature (LST), and the built-up area (BUA) near the landslide site. The developed LEWS was validated using various statistical error assessment tools such as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), confusion matrix, out-of-bag (OOB) error estimation, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The outcomes of this study can help to manage landslide hazards in the Himalayan urban–rural transition zones and serve as a sample study for similar mountainous regions of the world."

The implemented method consisted of an artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (ANN MLP), generated with the neuralnet R package, with which, by means of different backpropagation algorithms (RPROP+, RPROP−, SLR, SAG, and Backprop), five landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated for the study area. A landslide inventory updated to 2019 and 10 conditioning factors, mainly topographical, geological, land cover, and hydrological, were considered. The results obtained, which were validated through the AUC-ROC value and statistical parameters of precision, recall, accuracy, and F-Score, showed a good degree of adjustment and an acceptable predictive capacity. The resulting maps showed that the area has mostly sectors of moderate, high, and very high susceptibility, whose landslide occurrence percentages vary between approximately 63% and 80%.

This problem is commonly tackled by using limit equilibrium methods or advanced numerical techniques to assess the slope safety factor or, sometimes, even the displacement field of the slope. In this study, as an alternative approach, an attempt to assess the stability condition of homogeneous slopes was made using a machine learning (ML) technique. Specifically, a meta-heuristic algorithm (Harmony Search (HS) algorithm) and K-means algorithm were employed to perform a clustering analysis by considering two different classes, depending on whether a slope was unstable or stable. To achieve the purpose of this study, a database made up of 19 case studies with 6 model inputs including unit weight, intercept cohesion, angle of shearing resistance, slope angle, slope height and pore pressure ratio and one output (i.e., the slope safety factor) was established. Referring to this database, 17 out of 19 slopes were categorized correctly. Moreover, the obtained results showed that, referring to the considered database, the intercept cohesion was the most significant parameter in defining the class of each slope, whereas the unit weight had the smallest influence. Finally, the obtained results showed that the Harmony Search algorithm is an efficient approach for training K-means algorithms."

However, predictive uncertainty, which consists of input uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, and model uncertainty, is usually disregarded in deterministic data-driven modeling, and point estimates are separately presented. In this study, a probability-scheme combination ensemble prediction that employs quantile regression neural networks and kernel density estimation (QRNNs-KDE) is proposed for robust and accurate prediction and uncertainty quantification of landslide displacement. In the ensemble model, QRNNs serve as base learning algorithms to generate multiple base learners. Final ensemble prediction is obtained by integration of all base learners through a probability combination scheme based on KDE. The Fanjiaping landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA) was selected as a case study to explore the performance of the ensemble prediction. Based on long-term (2006–2018) and near real-time monitoring data, a comprehensive analysis of the deformation characteristics was conducted for fully understanding the triggering factors. The experimental results indicate that the QRNNs-KDE approach can perform predictions with perfect performance and outperform the traditional backpropagation (BP), radial basis function (RBF), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM) methods, bootstrap-extreme learning machine-artificial neural network (bootstrap-ELM-ANN), and Copula-kernel-based support vector machine quantile regression (Copula-KSVMQR).

As the development of technologies of remote sensing and artificial intelligence, the automatic detection of landslides becomes possible. The previous researches relative to the automatic detection of landslides utilized the machine learning methods to detect these new landslides which were significantly distinguished from their context. Compared to those landslides, the detection of old loess landslides that are not distinct from their context is more challenged. We explore the deep learning to automatically detect the old loess landslides.   Methods  Firstly, we build a loess landslide database consists of 2 498 which are interpreted from the Google Earth images by experts. Then, we divide the database into three datasets for training, validation and test. Finally, we train Mask R-CNN object detection module with the training dataset, choose the best model by the validation dataset, and apply the best model to the test dataset.   Results  The test results of model performance show a precision of 0.56, a recall of 0.72, and a F1-score of 0.63.   Conclusions  The results indicate that Mask R-CNN is a robust method even for the detection of loess landslides that are unapparent from the context, and deep learning can provide the possibility for rapid and accurate regional geo-hazard investigation."
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping and Driving Mechanisms in a Vulnerable Region Based on Multiple Machine Learning Models,"Haiwei Yu, Wenjie Pei, Jingyi Zhang, Guangsheng Chen",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15071886,https://openalex.org/W4362586328,"Landslides can cause severe damage to both the environment and society, and many statistical, index-based, and inventory-based methods have been developed to assess landslide susceptibility; however, it is still challenging to choose the most effective method and properly identify major driving factors for specific regions. Here, we applied four machine learning algorithms, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF), to predict the landslide susceptibility at 30 m spatial scale based on thirteen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) in a landslide-vulnerable region. Based on inventory landslide points, the classification results were evaluated, and indicated that the performance of the RF (F1-score: 0.85, AUC: 0.92), AdaBoost (F1-score: 0.83, AUC: 0.91), and GBDT (F1-score: 0.83, AUC: 0.88) methods were significantly better than the MLP (F1-score: 0.76, AUC: 0.79) method. The results further indicated that the areas with high and very high landslide risk (susceptibility greater than 0.5) accounted for about 40% of the study region. All four models matched well and predicted similar spatial distribution patterns in landslide susceptibility, with the very high risk areas mostly distributed in the western and southeastern regions. Daoshi, Qingliangfeng, Jinnan, and Linglong towns have the highest landslide risk, with mean susceptibility levels greater than 0.5. The leading contributing factors to landslide susceptibility were slightly different for the four models; however, population density, distance to road, and relief amplitude were generally among the top leading factors for most towns. Our study provided significant information on the highly landslide-prone areas and the major contributing factors for decision-makers and policy planners, and suggested that different areas should take unique precautions to mitigate or avoid severe damage from landslide events."
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping using Machine Learning Algorithm,"Muhammad Afaq Hussain, Zhanlong Chen, Run Wang, Safeer Ullah Shah, Muhammad Shoaib, Nafees Ali, Daozhu Xu, Chao Ma",2022,https://doi.org/10.28991/cej-2022-08-02-02,https://openalex.org/W4210431291,"Landslides are natural disasters that have resulted in the loss of economies and lives over the years. The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5%), 0.893 (89.3%), and 0.790 (79.0%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2022-08-02-02 Full Text: PDF"

However, the existing approaches of landslide susceptibility mapping cannot fully meet the requirement of landslide prevention, and further excavation and innovation are also needed. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to develop a novel deep learning model namely landslide net (LSNet) to assess the landslide susceptibility in Hanyin County, China, meanwhile, support vector machine model (SVM) and kernel logistic regression model (KLR) were employed as reference model. The inventory map was generated based on 259 landslides, the training dataset and validation dataset were, respectively, prepared using 70% landslides and the remaining 30% landslides. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was applied to optimize each landslide predisposing factor. Three benchmark indices were used to evaluate the result of susceptibility mapping and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was used to compare the models. Result demonstrated that although the processing speed of LSNet model is the slowest, it still significantly outperformed its corresponding benchmark models with validation dataset, and has the highest accuracy (0.950), precision (0.951), F1 (0.951) and AUROC (0.941), which reflected excellent predictive ability in some degree.

Rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is crucial for disaster prevention and disaster losses mitigation, though most studies are temporally ambiguous and on a regional scale. To better reveal landslide mechanisms and provide more accurate landslide susceptibility maps for landslide risk assessment and hazard prediction, developing a global dynamic LSM model is essential. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) as the main data platform and applied three tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithms to construct global, dynamic rainfall-induced LSM models based on dynamic and static landslide influencing factors. The dynamic perspective is used in LSM: dynamic changes in landslide susceptibility can be identified on a daily scale. We note that Random Forest algorithm offers robust performance for accurate LSM (AUC = 0.975) and although the classification accuracy of LightGBM is the highest (AUC = 0.977), the results do not meet the sufficient conditions of a landslide susceptibility map. Combined with quantitative precipitation products, the proposed model can be used for the release of historical and predictive global dynamic landslide susceptibility information."

The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated methodology to achieve such a mapping work with improved prediction results using hybrid modeling taking Chongren, Jiangxi as an example.

The results show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid modeling for landslide hazard mapping in which the prediction accuracy vs the validation set reach 82.35–91.02% with an AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve] of 0.912–0.970. The RF algorithm performs best among the observed three ML algorithms and WoE-based RF modeling will be recommended for the similar landslide risk prediction elsewhere. We believe that our research can provide an operational reference for predicting the landslide hazard in the subtropical area and serve for disaster reduction and prevention action of the local governments."
Landslide Displacement Prediction Based on Time Series Analysis and Double-BiLSTM Model,"Zian Lin, Xiyan Sun, Yuanfa Ji",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042077,https://openalex.org/W4212933004,"In recent years, machine learning models facilitated notable performance improvement in landslide displacement prediction. However, most existing prediction models which ignore landslide data at each time can provide a different value and meaning. To analyze and predict landslide displacement better, we propose a dynamic landslide displacement prediction model based on time series analysis and a double-bidirectional long short term memory (Double-BiLSTM) model. First, the cumulative landslide displacement is decomposed into trend and periodic displacement components according to time series analysis via the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) method. We consider that trend displacement is mainly influenced by landslide factors, and we apply a BiLSTM model to predict landslide trend displacement. This paper analyzes the internal relationship between rainfall, reservoir level and landslide periodic displacement. We adopt the maximum information coefficient (MIC) method to calculate the correlation between influencing factors and periodic displacement. We employ the BiLSTM model for periodic displacement prediction. Finally, the model is validated against data pertaining to the Baishuihe landslide in the Three Gorges, China. The experimental results and evaluation indicators demonstrate that this method achieves a better prediction performance than the classical prediction methods, and landslide displacement can be effectively predicted."

However, the development of such a system is complicated by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, and the consequent rapid changes that can occur in the structures of precipitation systems In this work, we develop two approaches (hereafter referred to as Nowcasting-Nets) that use Recurrent and Convolutional deep neural network structures to address the challenge of precipitation nowcasting. A total of five models are trained using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation data over the Eastern Contiguous United States (CONUS) and then tested against independent data for the Eastern and Western CONUS. The models were designed to provide forecasts with a lead time of up to 1.5 hours and, by using a feedback loop approach, the ability of the models to extend the forecast time to 4.5 hours was also investigated. Model performance was compared against the Random Forest (RF) and Linear Regression (LR) machine learning methods, and also against a persistence benchmark (BM) that used the most recent observation as the forecast. Independent IMERG observations were used as a reference, and experiments were conducted to examine both overall statistics and case studies involving specific precipitation events.

These natural disasters are related to geological and extreme meteorological phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes) occurring in regions that have already suffered similar previous natural catastrophes. Therefore, to effectively mitigate the landslide risks, new methodologies must better identify and understand all these landslide hazards through proper management. Within these methodologies, those based on assessing the landslide susceptibility increase the predictability of the areas where one of these disasters is most likely to occur. In the last years, much research has used machine learning algorithms to assess susceptibility using different sources of information, such as remote sensing data, spatial databases, or geological catalogues. This study presents the first attempt to develop a methodology based on an automatic machine learning (AutoML) framework. These frameworks are intended to facilitate the development of machine learning models, with the aim to enable researchers focus on data analysis. The area to test/validate this study is the center and southern region of Guerrero (Mexico), where we compare the performance of 16 machine learning algorithms. The best result achieved is the extra trees with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.983. This methodology yields better results than other similar methods because using an AutoML framework allows to focus on the treatment of the data, to better understand input variables and to acquire greater knowledge about the processes involved in the landslides."

In the experiment, a stacking ensemble learning (SEL) model is constructed based on convolutional neural network (CNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and support vector machine regression (SVR) to generate LSM by using topography, geology, human engineering activities, time-series precipitation and time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Road network, building distribution density and annual average precipitation data are used to evaluate landslide vulnerability based on entropy weight method. In this study, multiple statistical indicators are used to evaluate the performance of the LSM model, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) deformation data are utilized to verify the LRE results in Shenzhen. The results show that the SEL method has more refined results for LSM, with a best overall evaluation accuracy, especially in the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), where the accuracy is improved by nearly 8%.

One important aspect of effectively utilizing these algorithms is tuning the hyperparameters to match the specific task at hand. The selection and configuration of hyperparameters directly impact the performance of machine learning models. Achieving optimal hyperparameter settings often requires a deep understanding of the underlying models and the appropriate optimization techniques. While there are many automatic optimization techniques available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, this article focuses on hyperparameter optimization for well-known machine learning models. It explores cutting-edge optimization methods such as metaheuristic algorithms, deep learning-based optimization, Bayesian optimization, and quantum optimization, and our paper focused mainly on metaheuristic and Bayesian optimization techniques and provides guidance on applying them to different machine learning algorithms. The article also presents real-world applications of hyperparameter optimization by conducting tests on spatial data collections for landslide susceptibility mapping. Based on the experiment's results, both Bayesian optimization and metaheuristic algorithms showed promising performance compared to baseline algorithms. For instance, the metaheuristic algorithm boosted the random forest model's overall accuracy by 5% and 3%, respectively, from baseline optimization methods GS and RS, and by 4% and 2% from baseline optimization methods GA and PSO. Additionally, for models like KNN and SVM, Bayesian methods with Gaussian processes had good results. When compared to the baseline algorithms RS and GS, the accuracy of the KNN model was enhanced by BO-TPE by 1% and 11%, respectively, and by BO-GP by 2% and 12%, respectively. For SVM, BO-TPE outperformed GS and RS by 6% in terms of performance, while BO-GP improved results by 5%. The paper thoroughly discusses the reasons behind the efficiency of these algorithms.

An initial dataset of 36 variables was compiled to investigate the connection between slope morphology and landslide occurrence. Bagged trees, a machine-learning random-forest classifier, was used to evaluate the geomorphic variables, and 12 were identified as important: standard deviation of plan curvature, standard deviation of elevation, sum of plan curvature, minimum slope, mean plan curvature, range of elevation, sum of roughness, mean curvature, sum of curvature, mean roughness, minimum curvature and standard deviation of curvature. These variables were further evaluated using logistic regression to determine the probability of landslide occurrence and then used to create a landslide-susceptibility map. The performance of the logistic-regression model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve, which was 0.83. Standard deviations from the probability mean were used to set landslide-susceptibility classifications: low (0–0.10), low–moderate (0.11–0.27), moderate (0.28–0.44), moderate–high (0.45–0.61) and high (0.62–1.0). Logistic-regression results were validated by using a separate landslide inventory for the neighbouring Prestonsburg 7.5-minute quadrangle, and running the same regression function. Results indicate that 74.9% of the landslide deposits were identified as having moderate, moderate–high or high landslide susceptibility.

For improving mitigation, it is important to study the spatial distribution and factors controlling debris flows. In the Bailong River Basin, central China, landslides and debris flows are very well developed due to the large differences in terrain, the complex geological environment, and concentrated rainfall. For analysis, 52 influencing factors, statistical, machine learning, remote sensing and GIS methods were used to analyze the spatial distribution and controlling factors of 652 debris flow catchments with different frequencies. The spatial distribution of these catchments was divided into three zones according to their differences in debris flow frequencies. A comprehensive analysis of the relationship between various factors and debris flows was made. Through parameter optimization and feature selection, the Extra Trees classifier performed the best, with an accuracy of 95.6%. The results show that lithology was the most important factor controlling debris flows in the study area (with a contribution of 26%), followed by landslide density and factors affecting slope stability (road density, fault density and peak ground acceleration, with a total contribution of 30%). The average annual frequency of daily rainfall &gt; 20 mm was the most important triggering factor (with a contribution of 7%). Forest area and vegetation cover were also important controlling factors (with a total contribution of 9%), and they should be regarded as an important component of debris flow mitigation measures. The results are helpful to improve the understanding of factors influencing debris flows and provide a reference for the formulation of mitigation measures."

To identify the effect of data splitting on model performance, 2162 landslide points and an equal number of non-landslide points were used for training and testing the models using k-fold cross-validation, by varying the number of folds from two to ten. Results indicated that the spatial resolution of the dataset affects the performance of all the algorithms considered, while the effect of data splitting is significant in KNN and RF algorithms. All the algorithms yielded better performance while using the dataset with 12.5 m resolution for the same number of folds. It was also observed that the accuracy and area-under-the-curve values of 7, 8, 9, and 10-fold cross-validations with 30 m resolution was better than 2 and 3-fold cross-validations using 12.5 m resolution, in the case of RF algorithm."
Landslide susceptibility mapping using Forest by Penalizing Attributes (FPA) algorithm based machine learning approach,"Tran Van Phong, Hai‐Bang Ly, Phan Trọng Trịnh, Indra Prakash",2020,https://doi.org/10.15625/0866-7187/42/3/15047,https://openalex.org/W3037397572,"Landslide susceptibility mapping is a helpful tool for assessment and management of landslides of an area. In this study, we have applied first time Forest by Penalizing Attributes (FPA) algorithm-based Machine Learning (ML) approach for mapping of landslide susceptibility at Muong Lay district (Vietnam). For this aim, 217 historical landslides locations were identified and analyzed for the development of FPA model and generation of susceptibility map. Nine landslide topographical and geo-environmental conditioning factors (curvature, geology/lithology, aspect, distance from faults, rivers and roads, weathering crust, slope, and deep division) were utilized to construct the training and validating datasets for landslide modeling. Different quantitative statistical indices including Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the model. The results indicate that the predictive capability of the FPA is very good for landslide susceptibility mapping on both training (AUC = 0.935) and validating (AUC = 0.882) datasets. Thus, the novel FPA based ML model can be utilized for the development of accurate landslide susceptibility map of the study area and this approach can also be applied in other landslide prone areas."
Susceptibility mapping and zoning of highway landslide disasters in China,"Chao Yin, Haoran Li, Fa Che, Ying Li, Zhinan Hu, Dong Liu",2020,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235780,https://openalex.org/W3083519809,"Prominent regional differentiations of highway landslide disasters (HLDs) bring great difficulties in highway planning, designing and disaster mitigation, therefore, a comprehensive understanding of HLDs from the spatial perspective is a basis for reducing damages. Statistical prediction methods and machine learning methods have some defects in landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), meanwhile, hybrid methods have been developed by combining the statistical prediction methods with machine learning methods in recent years, and some of them were reported to perform better than conventional methods. In view of this, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to extract the susceptibility evaluation indexes of HLDs; the particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) model and genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) model were implemented to the susceptibility mapping and zoning of HLDs in China. The research results show that the accumulative contribution rate of the four principal components is 92.050%; evaluation results of the PSO-SVM model are better than those of the GA-SVM model; micro dangerous areas, moderate dangerous areas, severe dangerous areas and extreme dangerous areas account for 24.24%, 19.49%, 36.53% and 19.74% of the total areas of China; among the 1543 disaster points in the HLDs inventory, there are 134, 182, 421 and 806 located in the above areas respectively."
Towards landslide space-time forecasting through machine learning: the influence of rainfall parameters and model setting,"Nicola Nocentini, Ascanio Rosi, Samuele Segoni, Riccardo Fanti",2023,https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1152130,https://openalex.org/W4365455199,"Landslide susceptibility assessment using machine learning models is a popular and consolidated approach worldwide. The main constraint of susceptibility maps is that they are not adequate for temporal assessments: they are generated from static predisposing factors, allowing only a spatial prediction of landslides. Recently, some methodologies have been proposed to provide spatiotemporal landslides prediction starting from machine learning algorithms (e.g., combining susceptibility maps with rainfall thresholds), but the attempt to obtain a dynamic landslide probability map directly by applying machine learning models is still in the preliminary phase. This work provides a contribution to fix this gap, combining in a Random Forest (RF) algorithm a static indicator of the spatial probability of landslide occurrence (i.e., a classical susceptibility index) and a number of dynamic variables (i.e., seasonality and the rainfall amount cumulated over different reference periods). The RF implementation used in this work allows the calculation of the Out-of-Bag Error and depicts Partial Dependence Plots, two indices that were used to quantify the variables’ importance and to comprehend if the model outcomes are consistent with the triggering mechanism observed in the case of study (Metropolitan City of Florence, Italy). The goal of this research is not to set up a landslide probability map, but to 1) understand how to populate training and test datasets with observations sampled over space and time, 2) assess which rainfall variables are statistically more relevant for the identification of the time and location of landslides, and 3) test the dynamic application of RF in a forecasting model for the spatiotemporal prediction of landslides. The proposed dynamic methodology shows encouraging results, consistent with the actual knowledge of the physical mechanism of the triggering of shallow landslides (mainly influenced by short and intense rainfalls) and identifies some benchmark configurations that represents a promising starting point for future regional-scale applications of machine learning models to dynamic landslide probability assessment and early warning."
Landslide Risk Assessment Using a Combined Approach Based on InSAR and Random Forest,"Wangcai Liu, Yi Zhang, Yiwen Liang, Pingping Sun, Yuanxi Li, Xiaojun Su, Aijie Wang, Xingmin Meng",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14092131,https://openalex.org/W4225273624,"Landslide risk assessment is important for risk management and loss–damage reduction. Herein, we assessed landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk in the urban area of Yan’an City, which is located on the Loess Plateau of China and affected by many loess landslides. Based on 1841 slope units mapped in the study area, a random forest machine learning classifier and eight environmental factors influencing landslides were used for a landslide susceptibility assessment. In addition, differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) technology was used for a hazard assessment. The accuracy of the random forest is 0.903 and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve is 0.96. The results show that 16% and 22% of the slope units were classified as being at very high and high-susceptibility levels for landslides, respectively, whereas 16% and 24% of the slope units were at very high and high-hazard levels for landslides, respectively. The landslide risk was obtained based on the susceptibility map and hazard map of landslides. The results show that only 26% of the slope units were located at very high and high-risk levels for landslides and these are mainly concentrated in urban centers. Such risk zones should be taken seriously and their dynamics must be monitored. Our landslide risk map is expected to provide information for planners to help them choose appropriate locations for development schemes and improve integrated geohazard mitigation in Yan’an City."

The objective of this study was to conduct a landslide hazard susceptibility assessment for Ruijin, Jiangxi, China, and to provide technical support to the local government for implementing disaster reduction and prevention measures. Machine learning approaches, e.g., random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs) were employed and multiple geo-environmental factors such as land cover, NDVI, landform, rainfall, lithology, and proximity to faults, roads, and rivers, etc., were utilized to achieve our purposes. For categorical factors, three processing approaches were proposed: simple numerical labeling (SNL), weight assignment (WA)-based and frequency ratio (FR)-based. Then 19 geo-environmental factors were respectively converted into raster to constitute three 19-band datasets, i.e., DS1, DS2, and DS3 from three different processes. Then, 155 observed landslides that occurred in the past decades were vectorized, among which 70% were randomly selected to compose a training set (TS1) and the remaining 30% to form a validation set (VS1). A number of non-landslide (no-risk) samples distributed in the whole study area were identified in low slope (&lt;1–3°) zones such as urban areas and croplands, and also added to the TS1 and VS1 in the same ratio. For comparison, we used the FR approach to identify the no-risk samples in both flat and non-flat areas, and merged them into the field-observed landslides to constitute another pair of training and validation sets (TS2 and VS2) using the same ratio of 7:3. The RF algorithm was applied to model the probability of the landslide occurrence using DS1, DS2, and DS3 as predictive variables and TS1 and TS2 for training to obtain the SNL-based, WA-based, and FR-based RF models, respectively. Verified against VS1 and VS2, the three models have similar overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC), which are 89.61%, 91.47%, and 94.54%, and 0.7926, 0.8299, and 0.8908, respectively. All of them are much better than the three models obtained by SVM algorithm with OA of 81.79%, 82.86%, and 83%, and KC of 0.6337, 0.655, and 0.660. New case verification with the recent 26 landslide events of 2017–2020 revealed that the landslide susceptibility map from WA-based RF modeling was able to properly identify the high and very high susceptibility zones where 23 new landslides had occurred, and performed better than the SNL-based and FR-based RF modeling, though the latter has a slightly higher OA and KC. Hence, we concluded that all three RF models achieve reasonable risk prediction, but WA-based and FR-based RF modeling deserves a recommendation for application elsewhere. The results of this study may serve as reference for the local authorities in prevention and early warning of landslide hazards."
BS-LSTM: An Ensemble Recurrent Approach to Forecasting Soil Movements in the Real World,"Praveen Kumar, Priyanka Sihag, Prateek Chaturvedi, K. V. Uday, Varun Dutt",2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.696792,https://openalex.org/W3194487517,"Machine learning (ML) proposes an extensive range of techniques, which could be applied to forecasting soil movements using historical soil movements and other variables. For example, researchers have proposed recurrent ML techniques like the long short-term memory (LSTM) models for forecasting time series variables. However, the application of novel LSTM models for forecasting time series involving soil movements is yet to be fully explored. The primary objective of this research is to develop and test a new ensemble LSTM technique (called “Bidirectional-Stacked-LSTM” or “BS-LSTM”). In the BS-LSTM model, forecasts of soil movements are derived from a bidirectional LSTM for a period. These forecasts are then fed into a stacked LSTM to derive the next period’s forecast. For developing the BS-LSTM model, datasets from two real-world landslide sites in India were used: Tangni (Chamoli district) and Kumarhatti (Solan district). The initial 80% of soil movements in both datasets were used for model training and the last 20% of soil movements in both datasets were used for model testing. The BS-LSTM model’s performance was compared to other LSTM variants, including a simple LSTM, a bidirectional LSTM, a stacked LSTM, a CNN-LSTM, and a Conv-LSTM, on both datasets. Results showed that the BS-LSTM model outperformed all other LSTM model variants during training and test in both the Tangni and Kumarhatti datasets. This research highlights the utility of developing recurrent ensemble models for forecasting soil movements ahead of time."

In order to prevent and respond to landslides, it is necessary to identify vulnerable areas. This study identified areas that are likely to be damaged by landslides and aimed to predict future landslides. We compared and analyzed areas using machine learning (ML) algorithms, and conducted susceptibility mapping and landslide prediction using an algorithm that produced excellent results. For landslide predictions, the probability distribution of precipitation in the representative concentration pathway scenario 8.5 was used. We accounted for future uncertainties by using several regional climate model scenarios. Comparing the performances of different ML algorithms, the overall prediction accuracy of the random forest (0.932) was excellent. Susceptibility to landslides in the future determined using the random forest and five other regional climate models exhibited minor differences, but the average susceptibility increased over time. In addition, many urban areas are distributed around forest areas that have high landslide vulnerabilities, which provide important perspectives for urban and environmental planning."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Based on Positive Unlabeled Learning Coupled With Adaptive Sampling,"Zhice Fang, Yi Wang, Ruiqing Niu, Ling Peng",2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/jstars.2021.3125741,https://openalex.org/W3213199311,"Many studies consider landslide susceptibility prediction as a binary classification problem when using machine learning methods, which requires both landslide and non-landslide samples for modelling. Nevertheless, there are only landslide and unlabeled areas in the real world, and directly considering unlabeled areas as non-landslide areas may cause bias and incorrect label assignment. In this study, we present a positive unlabeled learning method coupled with adaptive sampling and random forest (AdaPU-RF) to predict landslide susceptibility in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. This method can make full use of the landslide and non-landslide information contained in unlabeled areas. Experimental results show that the AdaPU-RF method achieves desirable predication outcomes in terms of accuracy analysis, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis. Overall, the application of AdaPU-RF provides a new perspective for landslide susceptibility prediction, and can be recommended for other areas with similar geo-environmental conditions."
Susceptibility Assessment for Landslide Initiated along Power Transmission Lines,"Shuhao Liu, Kunlong Yin, Chao Zhou, Lei Gui, Xin Liang, Wei Lin, Binbin Zhao",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13245068,https://openalex.org/W4200192350,"The power network has a long transmission span and passes through wide areas with complex topography setting and various human engineering activities. They lead to frequent landslide hazards, which cause serious threats to the safe operation of the power transmission system. Thus, it is of great significance to carry out landslide susceptibility assessment for disaster prevention and mitigation of power network. We, therefore, undertake an extensive analysis and comparison study between different data-driven methods using a case study from China. Several susceptibility mapping results were generated by applying a multivariate statistical method (logistic regression (LR)) and a machine learning technique (random forest (RF)) separately with two different mapping-units and predictor sets of differing configurations. The models’ accuracies, advantages and limitations are summarized and discussed using a range of evaluation criteria, including the confusion matrix, statistical indexes, and the estimation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The outcome showed that machine learning method is well suitable for the landslide susceptibility assessment along transmission network over grid cell units, and the accuracy of susceptibility models is evolving rapidly from statistical-based models toward machine learning techniques. However, the multivariate statistical logistic regression methods perform better when computed over heterogeneous slope terrain units, probably because the number of units is significantly reduced. Besides, the high model predictive performances cannot guarantee a high plausibility and applicability of subsequent landslide susceptibility maps. The selection of mapping unit can produce greater differences on the generated susceptibility maps than that resulting from the selection of modeling methods. The study also provided a practical example for landslide susceptibility assessment along the power transmission network and its potential application in hazard early warning, prevention, and mitigation."

The logistic regression (LR) model was then applied to the four-ensemble machine learning model and generated a hybrid optimized machine learning model. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was then used to validate LS map. The best model of four LS models depending on ROC's area under curve (AUC) is PSO-ANN (AUC-0.958) model. Also, LR model-based hybrid ensemble machine learning model achieved better accuracy (AUC: 0.962) than PSO-ANN model.

However, KKH has extreme geological conditions that make it prone and vulnerable to natural disasters, primarily landslides, posing a threat to its routine activities. In this context, the study provides an updated inventory of landslides in the area with precisely measured slope deformation (Vslope), utilizing the SBAS-InSAR (small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar) and PS-InSAR (persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar) technology. By processing Sentinel-1 data from June 2021 to June 2023, utilizing the InSAR technique, a total of 571 landslides were identified and classified based on government reports and field investigations. A total of 24 new prospective landslides were identified, and some existing landslides were redefined. This updated landslide inventory was then utilized to create a landslide susceptibility model, which investigated the link between landslide occurrences and the causal variables. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) models, including convolutional neural networks (CNN 2D), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), are employed. The inventory was split into 70% for training and 30% for testing the models, and fifteen landslide causative factors were used for the susceptibility mapping. To compare the accuracy of the models, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used. The CNN 2D technique demonstrated superior performance in creating the landslide susceptibility map (LSM) for KKH. The enhanced LSM provides a prospective modeling approach for hazard prevention and serves as a conceptual reference for routine management of the KKH for risk assessment and mitigation."
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Machine Learning: A Danish Case Study,"Angelina Ageenko, Lærke Christina Hansen, Kevin Lundholm Lyng, Lars Bodum, Jamal Jokar Arsanjani",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11060324,https://openalex.org/W4281967563,"Mapping of landslides, conducted in 2021 by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), revealed 3202 landslides in Denmark, indicating that they might pose a bigger problem than previously acknowledged. Moreover, the changing climate is assumed to have an impact on landslide occurrences in the future. The aim of this study is to conduct the first landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in Denmark, reducing the geographical bias existing in LSM studies, and to identify areas prone to landslides in the future following representative concentration pathway RCP8.5, based on a set of explanatory variables in an area of interest located around Vejle Fjord, Jutland, Denmark. A subset from the landslide inventory provided by GEUS is used as ground truth data. Three well-established machine learning (ML) algorithms—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression—were trained to classify the data samples as landslide or non-landslide, treating the ML task as a binary classification and expressing the results in the form of a probability in order to produce susceptibility maps. The classification results were validated through the test data and through an external data set for an area located outside of the region of interest. While the high predictive performance varied slightly among the three models on the test data, the LR and SVM demonstrated inferior accuracy outside of the study area. The results show that the RF model has robustness and potential for applicability in landslide susceptibility mapping in low-lying landscapes of Denmark in the present. The conducted mapping can become a step forward towards planning for mitigative and protective measures in landslide-prone areas in Denmark, providing policy-makers with necessary decision support. However, the map of the future climate change scenario shows the reduction of the susceptible areas, raising the question of the choice of the climate models and variables in the analysis."

In this method, the spatial proximity and spatial topological relationships were extracted as spatial features, and the influencing factors associated with landslide occurrences were selected as attribute features. Then, the integrated expression of the spatial and attribute features of a landslide case was further constructed. Finally, attribute similarity and spatial similarity were used for joint reasoning. This study then carried out experiments in Lushan, China. Upon comparison of the three CBR models, the proposed integrated CBR outperformed the other models. Furthermore, an optimized support vector machine and a deep convolutional neural network were selected as experimental methods in the control group. The results show that the proposed integrated CBR has better performance. In conclusion, the proposed integrated CBR can be effectively applied to regional landslide risk evaluation and other similar geospatial problems."

To effectively manage land use and reduce the risk of landslides, it is crucial to conduct susceptibility assessments. To date, many machine-learning methods have been applied to the landslide susceptibility map (LSM). However, as a risk prediction, landslide susceptibility without good interpretability would be a risky approach to apply these methods to real life. This study aimed to assess the LSM in the region of Nayong in Guizhou, China, and conduct a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of landslide susceptibility maps utilizing an explainable artificial intelligence. This study incorporates remote sensing data, field surveys, geographic information system techniques, and interpretable machine-learning techniques to analyze the sensitivity to landslides and to contrast it with other conventional models. As an interpretable machine-learning method, generalized additive models with structured interactions (GAMI-net) could be used to understand how LSM models make decisions. The results showed that the GAMI-net model was valid and had an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.91 on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is better than the values of 0.85 and 0.81 for the random forest and SVM models, respectively. The coal mining, rock desertification, and rainfall greater than 1300 mm were more susceptible to landslides in the study area. Additionally, the pairwise interaction factors, such as rainfall and mining, lithology and rainfall, and rainfall and elevation, also increased the landslide susceptibility. The results showed that interpretable models could accurately predict landslide susceptibility and reveal the causes of landslide occurrence. The GAMI-net-based model exhibited good predictive capability and significantly increased model interpretability to inform landslide management and decision making, which suggests its great potential for application in LSM."
What Geotechnical Engineers Want to Know about Reliability,Kok‐Kwang Phoon,2023,https://doi.org/10.1061/ajrua6.rueng-1002,https://openalex.org/W4362630925,"The purpose of this paper is to address the ""what,"" ""why,"" and ""how"" questions posed by engineers who are not familiar with geotechnical reliability and have not kept abreast of recent rapid developments in this field. Geotechnical reliability can be broadly defined as a methodology that enhances decision making at different life-cycle stages covering design, construction, operation and maintenance, retrofit, and decommission/reuse by exploiting the richer characterization of data using probabilistic models. Besides engineered systems, it also covers the risk assessment and management of geohazards such as earthquakes and landslides. Various application areas related to the design and construction stages of engineered systems can be put in context in the form of an uncertainty-informed Burland Triangle. Among these application areas, the estimation of a characteristic value, load and resistance factor design (LRFD), resistance factor calibration for simplified reliability-based design (RBD), and first-order second-moment (FOSM) reliability analysis do not need in-depth knowledge/expertise in reliability and a significant amount of information exists to support these applications in practice. This paper argues for their adoption because they will nudge a mindset shift to be more responsive to data. Data infrastructure is now considered to be as important as physical infrastructure. The concern that there are insufficient data for probabilistic analysis has also been largely and comprehensively resolved by recent advances in Bayesian machine learning methods that can deal with MUSIC-3X (Multivariate, Uncertain and Unique, Sparse, Incomplete, and potentially Corrupted with ""3X"" denoting 3D spatial variability) site data directly. Sparsity (insufficient data) is only one out of six attributes in a real-world MUSIC-3X data set. Geotechnical reliability is now pictured as one important step toward digital transformation and engaging complex new challenges posed by climate change and resilience engineering. This paper urges the geotechnical engineering profession to lay aside its questions on quantity, quality, and/or other ""ugly"" attributes and offer our data an opportunity to speak for itself. There is prima facie evidence to warrant a thorough exploration of data-centric geotechnics."

Considering the first step in landslide disaster management, different methods have been applied but no methods found as best one. As a result, landslide assessment using different methods in different geographical regions has significant importance. The research aims to prepare and evaluate landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) of the Chattogram district using three machine learning algorithms of Logistic Regression (LR), Random forest (RF) and Decision and Regression Tree (DRT). Sixteen landslide conditioning factors were determined considering topographic, hydro-climatic, geologic and anthropogenic influence. The landslide inventory database (255 locations) was randomly divided into training (80 %) and testing (20 %) sets. The LSMs showed that almost 9-12 % of areas of the Chattogram district are highly susceptible to landslides. The highly susceptible zones cover the Chattogram district's hill ranges where active morphological processes (erosion and denudation) are dominant. The ROC values for training data were 0.943, 0.917 and 0.947 and testing data were 0.963, 0.934 and 0.905 for LR, RF and DRT models, respectively. The accuracy is higher than the previous research in comparison to the extent of the study area and the size of the inventory. Among the models, LR showed the highest prediction rate and DRT showed the highest success rate. According to susceptibility zones, DRT is the more realistic model followed by LR. The maps can be applied at the local scale for landslide hazard management."
Graph neural networks with constraints of environmental consistency for landslide susceptibility evaluation,"Haowei Zeng, Qing Zhu, Yulin Ding, Han Hu, Li Chen, Xiao Xie, Min Chen, Yao Yan-xia",2022,https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2022.2103819,https://openalex.org/W4288438259,"In complex and heterogeneous geoenvironments, landslides exhibit varying features in different environments, and data in landslide inventories are imbalanced. Existing data-driven landslide susceptibility evaluation (LSE) methods overlook environmental heterogeneity and cannot reliably predict regions with few samples. Alternatively, global random negative sampling strategies may produce imbalanced positive and negative samples in some environments, contributing to inaccurate predictions. This article proposes a graph neural network (GNN) constrained by environmental consistency (GNN-EC) to overcome these problems. The GNN-EC consists of graphs with nodes, and edges. A graph represents the environmental relationships in the study area. Nodes are geographic units delineated from terrain polygon approximation. Edges capture the relationships between node-pairs. Additionally, the weights of edges reflect the similarity between two node environments. A GNN aggregates node information in the graph for LSE. Our experiment showed that the proposed method outperformed the common machine learning methods: increasing prediction accuracy by approximately 7, 5–6 and 3–4% compared to the artificial neural network (ANN), the support vector machine (SVM) and the random forest (RF), respectively. Moreover, our method can maintain high prediction accuracy, even with a small training set."
Essential insights into decision mechanism of landslide susceptibility mapping based on different machine learning models,"Deliang Sun, Yuekai Ding, Jialan Zhang, Haijia Wen, Yue Wang, Jiahui Xu, Xinzhi Zhou, Rui Liu",2022,https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2146763,https://openalex.org/W4308808788,"This work aims to discuss and compare the inherent essence of different machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility models (LSMs), which is of great significance for accurate prevention and detection of landslides. A geospatial database was established in GIS based on various factors of topography, geological conditions, environmental conditions and human activities, including 22 conditioning factors and 866 historical landslides. As for model algorithms, ANN is an operation model composed of a large number of interconnected nodes, and RF refers to an ensemble method of separately trained binary decision trees. Two algorithms were adopted in this paper for landslide susceptibility models. Meantime, an interpretable algorithm SHAP was used to gain insight into essential decision mechanism of LSMs. The result showed that RF model exhibits better stability and robustness. The global interpretation shows that the same landslide moderators play different roles in different models. The local interpretation shows that for the same evaluation unit different models give different decision mechanisms, and the local interpretation can be combined with the field survey, which can provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the assigned landslide."

With the recent advancements in the geoinformation domain, landslide documentation and inventorization can be achieved with automated workflows using aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). As a result, ultra-high-resolution datasets are available for analysis at low operational costs. In this study, different segmentation and classification approaches were utilized for object-based landslide mapping. An integrated object-based image analysis (OBIA) workflow is presented incorporating orthophotomosaics and digital surface models (DSMs) with expert-based and machine learning (ML) algorithms. For segmentation, trial and error tests and the Estimation of Scale Parameter 2 (ESP 2) tool were implemented for the evaluation of different scale parameters. For classification, machine learning algorithms (K- Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) were assessed with the inclusion of spectral, spatial, and contextual characteristics. For the ML classification of landslide zones, 60% of the reference segments have been used for training and 40% for validation of the models. The quality metrics of Precision, Recall, and F1 were implemented to evaluate the models’ performance under the different segmentation configurations. Results highlight higher performances for landslide mapping when DSM information was integrated. Hence, the configuration of spectral and DSM layers with the RF classifier resulted in the highest classification agreement with an F1 value of 0.85."
Landslide susceptibility mapping by attentional factorization machines considering feature interactions,"Leilei Liu, Can Yang, Faming Huang, Xiaomi Wang",2021,https://doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2021.1950217,https://openalex.org/W3191597219,"Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a commonly used approach to reduce landslide risk. However, conventional LSM methods generally only consider the influence of each single conditioning factor on landslide occurrence or absence, which neglects the interactions of different conditioning factors and may lead to biased LSM results. Therefore, this study aims to use a new machine learning model—attentional factorization machines (AFM)—to explicitly consider the influence of feature interactions in LSM to improve and obtain more reliable LSM results. The Anhua County in China is chosen as the study area. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and statistical indicators are used to evaluate the performance of LSM models. For comparison, the common LSM models such as the logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models are also used to conduct the LSM. The results show that the performance of AFM is a little better than RF in the AUC metric, whereas the LR model has the worst performance. Compared with general LSM models, AFM considers feature interactions by introducing an attention mechanism to learn the weight of different feature combinations, which not only ensures the model interpretability but also improves the model performance."
Improvement of landslide spatial modeling using machine learning methods and two Harris hawks and bat algorithms,"Sina Paryani, Aminreza Neshat, Biswajeet Pradhan",2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrs.2021.08.006,https://openalex.org/W3198550055,"Landslide is a natural phenomenon that can turn into a natural disaster. The main goal of this research was to spatial prediction of a high-risk region located in the Zagros mountains, Iran, using hybrid machine learning and metaheuristic algorithms, namely the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), the Harris hawks optimisation (HHO), and the bat algorithm (BA). The landslide occurrences were first divided into training and testing datasets with a 70/30 ratio. Fourteen landslide-related factors were considered, and the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) were employed to determine the correlation between landslides and factors. After that, the hybrid models of ANFIS-HHO, ANFIS-BA, SVR-HHO and SVR-BA were applied to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs). Finally, in order to validation and comparison of the applied models, two indexes, namely mean square error (MSE) and area under the ROC curve (AUROC), were used. According to the validation results, the AUROC values for the ANFIS-HHO, ANFIS-BA, SVR-HHO and SVR-BA were 0.849, 0.82, 0.895, and 0.865, respectively. The SVR-HHO showed the highest accuracy, with AUROC of 0.895 and lowest MSE of 0.147, and ANFIS-BA showed the least accuracy with an AUROC value of 0.82 and MSE value of 0.218. Based on the results, although four hybrid models with more than 80% accuracy can generate very good results, the SVR is superior to the ANFIS model, whereas the HHO algorithm outperformed the bat algorithm. The map generated in this study can be employed by land use planners in more efficient management."

Thus, landslide displacement prediction remains a popular but difficult topic of research. In this paper, a landslide prediction model is proposed by combining extreme learning machine (ELM) and random search support vector regression (RS-SVR) sub-models. Particularly, the combined model decomposed accumulative landslide displacement into two terms, trend and periodic displacements, using a time series model, and simulated and predicted the two terms using the ELM and RS-SVR sub-models, respectively. The predicted trend and periodic terms are then summed to obtain the total displacement. The ELM and RS-SVR sub-models are applied to predict the deformation of Baishuihe landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) as an example. The results showed that the model effectively improved the accuracy, stability, and scope of application of landslide displacement prediction, thus providing a new method for landslide displacement prediction."

Consequently, it is crucial to highlight the regions prone to future landslides by examining the correlation between past landslides and various geo-environmental factors. This study aims to investigate the optimal data selection and machine learning model, or ensemble technique, for evaluating the vulnerability of areas to landslides and determining the most accurate approach. To attain our objectives, we considered two different scenarios for selecting landslide-free random points (a slope threshold and a buffer-based approach) and performed a comparative analysis of five machine learning models for landslide susceptibility mapping, namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The study area for this research is an area in Polk County in Western North Carolina that has experienced fatal landslides, leading to casualties and significant damage to infrastructure, properties, and road networks. The model construction process involves the utilization of a dataset comprising 1215 historical landslide occurrences and 1215 non-landslide points. We integrated a total of fourteen geospatial data layers, consisting of topographic variables, soil data, geological data, and land cover attributes. We use various metrics to assess the models' performance, including accuracy, F1-score, Kappa score, and AUC-ROC. In addition, we used the seeded-cell area index (SCAI) to evaluate map consistency. The ensemble of the five models using Weighted Average produces outstanding results, with an AUC-ROC of 99.4% for the slope threshold scenario and 91.8% for the buffer-based scenario. Our findings emphasize the significant impact of non-landslide random sampling on model performance in landslide susceptibility mapping. Furthermore, by optimally identifying landslide-prone regions and hotspots that need urgent risk management and land use planning, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in analyzing landslide susceptibility and providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and disaster risk reduction initiatives."

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) plays a crucial role in the evaluation and extenuation of risk. To date, a large number of machine learning approaches have been applied to LSM. Of late, a high-level convolutional neural network (CNN) has been applied with the intention of raising the forecast precision of LSM. The primary contribution of the research was to present a model which was based on the CNN for LSM and methodically compare its capability with the traditional machine learning approaches, namely, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF). Subsequently, we used this model in the Wenchuan region, where a catastrophic earthquake happened on 12 May 2008 in China. There were 405 valuable landslides in the landslide inventory, which were divided into a training set (283 landslides) and validation set (122 landslides). Furthermore, 11 landslide causative factors were selected as the model’s input, and each model’s output was reclassified into five intervals according to the sensitivity. We also evaluated the model’s performance by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and several statistical metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and other measures. The results indicated that the CNN-based methods achieved the best performance, with the success-rate curve (SRC) and prediction-rate curve (PRC) approaches reaching 93.14% and 91.81%, respectively. The current research indicated that the approach based on the CNN for LSM had both outstanding goodness-of-fit and excellent prediction capability.

Long-term interactions between rock uplift and river undercutting developed widely distributed landslides in this catchment, which recorded the typical tectonic geomorphology in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we examined the landslides in the Minjiang catchment and aimed to compare the prediction ability of the statistical and machine learning (ML) models in landslide susceptibility assessment. We adopted the statistical models of the frequency ratio (FR) and information value (IV) models, and the ML models represented by a logistic model tree (LMT) and radial basis function classifier (RBFC) for landslide prediction. An inventory map of 668 landslides was compiled, and the landslides were randomly divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets. Furthermore, 11 control factors of landslides based on topography, geology, hydrology, and other environments were applied for the analysis. The comprehensive performance of the four models was validated and compared using accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results indicated that both sides of the valley along the Mingjiang and Heishuihe Rivers are in the high and very high susceptibility zones; in particular, the river segment from Wenchuan to Maoxian County has the highest susceptibility. The AUC values of the FR, IV, LMT, and RBFC models with the training data were 0.842, 0.862, 0.898, and 0.894, respectively, while the validation dataset illustrated the highest AUC value of 0.879 in the LMT model, followed by the RBFC (0.871), IV (0.869), and FR (0.839) models. Moreover, the LMT and RBFC models had higher accuracy values than the FR and IV models. This suggests that the ML models are superior to the statistical models in generating adequate landslide susceptibility maps, and the LMT model is the most efficient one for landslide prediction in the study region. This study provides a typical case in a landslide-prone region in the plateau margin to advance the understanding of landslide susceptibility assessment."

A total of 16 layers were extracted from the collected data and employed as conditional factors for the correlation analysis and subsequent modelling. The LSMs were then divided into four levels (very high susceptibility (VH), high susceptibility (H), moderate susceptibility (M) and low susceptibility (L)). The results were verified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Frequency Ratio (FR). The higher of the area under ROC curve (AUC) and the lower the RMSE, the more accurate and stable the performance.

Taking the Fenxi Coal Mine Area of Shanxi Province in China as the research area, landslide data has been investigated by the Shanxi Geological Environment Monitoring Center; adopting the 5-fold cross-validation method, and through Geostatistics analysis means the datasets of all non-landslides and landslides were divided into 80:20 proportions randomly for training and validating models. A set of 15 condition factors including terrain, geological, hydrological, land cover, and human engineering activity factors (distance to road, distance to mined area, ground collapse density) were selected as the evaluation indices to construct the susceptibility assessment model. Three machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) including C5.0 Decision Tree (C5.0), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been selected and compared through the Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves (AUC), and several statistical estimates. The study revealed that for these three models the value range of prediction accuracies vary from 83.49 to 99.29% (in the training stage), and 62.26–73.58% (in the validation stage). In the two stages, AUCs are between 0.92 to 0.99 and 0.71 to 0.80 respectively. Using Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm, three LSPs levels are established as very low, low, medium, high, and very high probability of landslide by dividing the indices of the LSP. Compared with RF and SVM, C5.0 is considered better in five categories according to quantities and distribution of the landslides and their area percentage for different LSP zones. Four factors such as distance to road, lithology, profile curvature, and ground collapse density are the most suitable condition factors for LSP. The distance to mine area factor has a medium contribution and plays an obvious role in the occurrence of landslides in all the models. The result reveals that C5.0 possesses better prediction efficiency than RF and SVM, and underground mined area and ground collapse sifnigicantly affect significantly the occurrence of landslides in the Fenxi Coal Mine Area."

Multiple landslide events occur often across the world which have the potential to cause significant harm to both human life and property. Although a substantial amount of research has been conducted to address mapping of landslides using Earth observation (EO) data, several gaps and uncertainties remain with developing models to be operational at the global scale. The lack of a high-resolution globally distributed and event-diverse dataset for landslide segmentation poses a challenge in developing machine learning models that can accurately and robustly detect landslides in various regions, as the limited representation of landslide and background classes can result in poor generalization performance of the models. To address this issue, we present the High-Resolution Global landslide Detector Database (HR-GLDD), a high-resolution (HR) satellite dataset (PlanetScope, 3 m pixel resolution) for landslide mapping composed of landslide instances from 10 different physiographical regions globally in South and South-East Asia, East Asia, South America, and Central America. The dataset contains five rainfall-triggered and five earthquake-triggered multiple landslide events that occurred in varying geomorphological and topographical regions in the form of standardized image patches containing four PlanetScope image bands (red, green, blue, and NIR) and a binary mask for landslide detection. The HR-GLDD can be accessed through this link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7189381 (Meena et al., 2022a, c). HR-GLDD is one of the first datasets for landslide detection generated by high-resolution satellite imagery which can be useful for applications in artificial intelligence for landslide segmentation and detection studies. Five state-of-the-art deep learning models were used to test the transferability and robustness of the HR-GLDD. Moreover, three recent landslide events were used for testing the performance and usability of the dataset to comment on the detection of newly occurring significant landslide events. The deep learning models showed similar results when testing the HR-GLDD at individual test sites, thereby indicating the robustness of the dataset for such purposes. The HR-GLDD is open access and it has the potential to calibrate and develop models to produce reliable inventories using high-resolution satellite imagery after the occurrence of new significant landslide events. The HR-GLDD will be updated regularly by integrating data from new landslide events."

To achieve accuracy prediction of landslide displacement, a displacement prediction model based on a salp-swarm-algorithm-optimized temporal convolutional network (SSA-TCN) is proposed. The TCN model, consisting of a causal dilation convolution layer residual block, can flexibly increase the receptive fields and capture the global information in a deeper layer. SSA can solve the hyperparameter problem well for TCN model. The Muyubao landslide displacement collected from a professional GPS monitoring system implemented in 2006 is used to analyze the displacement features of the slope and evaluate the performance of the SSA-TCN model. The cumulative displacement time series is decomposed into trend displacement (linear part) and periodic displacement (nonlinear part) by the variational modal decomposition (VMD) method. Then, a polynomial function is used to predict the trend displacement, and the SSA-TCN model is used to predict the periodic displacement of the landslide based on considering the response relationship between periodic displacement, rainfall, and reservoir water. This research also compares the proposed approach results with the other popular machine learning and deep learning models. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model is superior to and more effective and accurate than the others at predicting the landslide displacement."

Fifteen landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were selected and an inventory of 368 landslides was used for the analysis. Multicollinearity analysis using the variation inflation factor, tolerance and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) depicted less to no similarity between all factors. Evaluation of variable importance suggests LCFs such as slope, elevation and distance to thrust contributed significantly and consistently for all three models. Model accuracy was determined and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and other statistical signifiers like accuracy, sensitivity, F-measure, accuracy, specificity and recall. The results show that the ensemble algorithms, XGB and RF, yield higher accuracy of approximately 85% compared to the KNN model with 81% accuracy."
A first step towards a IoT-based local early warning system for an unsaturated slope in Norway,"Luca Piciullo, Vittoria Capobianco, Håkon Heyerdahl",2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-022-05524-3,https://openalex.org/W4296049787,"Abstract A framework for a IoT-based local landslide early warning system (Lo-LEWS) has been proposed. Monitoring, modelling, forecasting and warning represent the main phases of the proposed framework. In this study, the first two phases have been applied to capture the hydrological behaviour of a natural unsaturated slope located adjacent to a railway track in Eastern Norway. The slope is monitored and the stability is kept under frequent observation, due to its steepness and the presence of the railway lines at the toe. The commercial software GeoStudio SEEP was used to create and calibrate a model able to replicate the in situ monitored volumetric water content (VWC) and pore water pressure (PWP) regime. The simulations conducted were divided into two main series: one with an initial calibration of the VWC profile (C) and another with no calibration (NC). The simulations have been validated using Taylor diagrams, which graphically summarize how closely a pattern (or a set of patterns) matches observations. The results show that a preliminary calibration for matching the in situ VWC, as well as considering climate conditions and vegetation, are crucial aspects to model the response of the studied unsaturated slope. A sensitivity analysis on the hydraulic conductivity and the permeability anisotropy ratio contributed to better define the input data and to improve the best-fit model result. The effectiveness of the best simulation, in back-calculating VWC, was tested for 3 different time periods: 6-month, 1-year, 1.25-year. The results show that the hydrological model can adequately represent the real monitored conditions up to a 1-year period, a recalibration is needed afterward. In addition, a slope stability analysis with GeoStudio SLOPE for the 1-year period was coupled to the hydrological model. Finally, the calculated safety factor (FS), the temperature, the precipitation, the VWC and PWP monitored were used as input dataset for a supervised machine learning algorithm. A random forest model highlighted the importance of the monitored VWC for forecasting the FS. The findings presented in this paper can be seen as a first step towards an Internet of Things (IoT)-based real-time slope stability analysis that can be employed as Lo-LEWS."

Various machine learning models (MLMs) have been used to increase the accuracy of soil moisture content prediction. The present investigation aims to apply MLMs with novel structures for the estimation of daily volumetric soil water content, based on the stacking of the multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR). Two groups of input variables were considered: the first (Model A) consisted of various meteorological variables (i.e., daily precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed), and the second (Model B) included only daily precipitation. The stacked model (SM) had the best performance (R2 = 0.962) in the prediction of daily volumetric soil water content for both categories of input variables when compared with the MLP (R2 = 0.957), RF (R2 = 0.956) and SVR (R2 = 0.951) models. Overall, the SM, which, in general, allows the weaknesses of the individual basic algorithms to be overcome while still maintaining a limited number of parameters and short calculation times, can lead to more accurate predictions of soil water content than those provided by more commonly employed MLMs."
Distribution Modeling and Factor Correlation Analysis of Landslides in the Large Fault Zone of the Western Qinling Mountains: A Machine Learning Algorithm,"Tianjun Qi, Yan Zhao, Xingmin Meng, Wei Shi, Feng Qing, Guan Chen, Yi Zhang, Dongxia Yue, Fuyun Guo",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13244990,https://openalex.org/W4200097059,"The area comprising the Langma-Baiya fault zone (LBFZ) and the Bailongjiang fault zone (BFZ) in the Western Qinling Mountains in China is characterized by intensive, frequent, multi-type landslide disasters. The spatial distribution of landslides is affected by factors, such as geological structure, landforms, climate and human activities, and the distribution of landslides in turn affects the geomorphology, ecological environment and human activities. Here, we present the results of a detailed landslide inventory of the area, which recorded a total of 2765 landslides. The landslides are divided into three categories according to relative age, area, and type of movement. Sixteen factors related to geological structure, geomorphology, materials composition and human activities were selected and four machine learning algorithms were used to model the spatial distribution of landslides. The aim was to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between the spatial distribution of landslides and the contributing factors. Based on a comparison of model accuracy and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, RandomForest (RF) (accuracy of 92%, area under the ROC of 0.97) and GradientBoosting (GB) (accuracy of 96%, area under the ROC curve of 0.97) were selected to predict the spatial distribution of unclassified landslides and classified landslides, respectively. The evaluation results reveal the following. The vegetation coverage index (NDVI) (correlation of 0.2, and the same below) and distance to road (DTR) (0.13) had the highest correlations with the distribution of unclassified landslides. NDVI (0.18) and the annual precipitation index (API) (0.14) had the highest correlations with the distribution of landslides of different ages. API (0.16), average slope (AS) (0.14) and NDVI (0.1) had the highest correlations with the landslide distribution on different scales.

Uncertainties in landslide susceptibility prediction: Influence rule of different levels of errors in landslide spatial position,"Faming Huang, Ronghui Li, Filippo Catani, Xiaoting Zhou, Ziqiang Zeng, Jinsong Huang",2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2024.02.001,https://openalex.org/W4392520242,"The accuracy of landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) mainly depends on the precision of the landslide spatial position. However, the spatial position error of landslide survey is inevitable, resulting in considerable uncertainties in LSP modeling. To overcome this drawback, this study explores the influence of positional errors of landslide spatial position on LSP uncertainties, and then innovatively proposes a semi-supervised machine learning model to reduce the landslide spatial position error. This paper collected 16 environmental factors and 337 landslides with accurate spatial positions taking Shangyou County of China as an example. The 30–110 m error-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) and random forest (RF) models for LSP are established by randomly offsetting the original landslide by 30, 50, 70, 90 and 110 m. The LSP uncertainties are analyzed by the LSP accuracy and distribution characteristics. Finally, a semi-supervised model is proposed to relieve the LSP uncertainties. Results show that: (1) The LSP accuracies of error-based RF/MLP models decrease with the increase of landslide position errors, and are lower than those of original data-based models; (2) 70 m error-based models can still reflect the overall distribution characteristics of landslide susceptibility indices, thus original landslides with certain position errors are acceptable for LSP; (3) Semi-supervised machine learning model can efficiently reduce the landslide position errors and thus improve the LSP accuracies."

The accuracy of the landslide susceptibility prediction model based on machine learning is significantly higher than that of traditional expert knowledge and the conventional mathematical statistics model. The correct and reasonable selection of non-landslide samples in the machine learning model greatly improves the prediction accuracy and reliability of the regional landslide susceptibility model. Focusing on the problem of selecting non-landslide samples in the machine learning model for landslide susceptibility evaluation, this paper proposes a landslide susceptibility evaluation method based on the combination of an information model and machine learning in traditional mathematical statistics. First, the influence factors for landslide susceptibility evaluation are screened by the correlation analysis method. Second, the information value model is used to delimit areas with low and relatively low landslide susceptibility, and non-landslide points are randomly selected. Third, a landslide susceptibility evaluation method combined with IV-ML, such as logistic regression (IV-LR), random forest (IV-RF), support vector machine (IV-SVM), and artificial neural network (IV-ANN), is established. Finally, the landslide susceptibility factors in the Dabie Mountain area of Anhui Province are analyzed, and the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility evaluation results using the IV-LR, IV-RF, IV-SVM, and IV-ANN and LR, RF, SVM, and ANN methods are compared. The accuracy is evaluated by examining the ACC, AUC, and kappa values of the model. The results indicate that the evaluation effect of the IV-ML models (IV-LR, IV-RF, IV-SVM, IV-ANN) on landslide susceptibility is significantly higher than that of the ML models (LR, RF, SVM, ANN)."

In this study, we proposed a novel multi-hazard susceptibility assessment approach that combines expert-based and supervised machine learning methods for landslide, flood, and earthquake hazard assessments for a basin in Elazig Province, Türkiye. To produce the landslide susceptibility map, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, random forest, was chosen because of its known performance in similar studies. The modified analytical hierarchical process method was used to produce the flood susceptibility map by using factor scores that were defined specifically for the area in the study. The seismic hazard was assessed using ground motion parameters based on Arias intensity values. The univariate maps were synthesized with a Mamdani fuzzy inference system using membership functions designated by expert. The results show that the random forest provided an overall accuracy of 92.3% for landslide susceptibility mapping. Of the study area, 41.24% were found prone to multi-hazards (probability value &gt; 50%), but the southern parts of the study area are more susceptible. The proposed model is suitable for multi-hazard susceptibility assessment at a regional scale although expert intervention may be required for optimizing the algorithms."
Performance comparison of landslide susceptibility mapping under multiple machine-learning based models considering InSAR deformation: a case study of the upper Jinsha River,"Jiaming Yao, Xin Yao, Zheng Zhao, Xinghong Liu",2023,https://doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2023.2212833,https://openalex.org/W4379511989,"Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) comprehensively evaluates the spatial probability of landslide occurrence by using different environmental factors. However, most of the evaluation methods ignore the dynamic characteristic factors of landslides, which makes it difficult to obtain reliable prediction results. Taking the upper reaches of the Jinsha River as the study area, this article introduces the deformation data into the landslide characteristic model and proposes an improved landslide susceptibility evaluation method. Four kinds of landslide susceptibility machine learning models were constructed by collecting 20 landslide related factors. The prediction accuracy of machine learning models is compared, and the performance of different models and the improvement of model performance by deformation information are evaluated. The results show that the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost model is better than SVM and logistic regression model. The prediction accuracy of Random Forest and XGBoost model is improved obviously after InSAR deformation is introduced. 96.9 and 93.19% of landslide areas were reasonably classified as high or very high risk levels. Compared with the calculation result of traditional model, the proportion of high and very high risk pixels in landslide area is increased by 2.97 and 1.13%, respectively. In addition, the percentage of high and very high risk areas in the susceptibility evaluation area increased from 15.45 to 16.23% and 18.73 to 21.89%, respectively. The accuracy of Random Forest and XGBoost models increased from 0.793 to 0.878 and 0.776 to 0.812, respectively, and the AUC increased by 0.9 and 1.7%, respectively. The SHAP and traditional feature importance analysis reveals that rainfall, aspect, temperature and NDVI are the main influencing factors of landslide in the upper reaches of the Jinsha River."

The primary purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of three machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for landslide susceptibility mapping including random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM). We selected a case study region that is frequently affected by landslides, the important Kamyaran–Sarvabad road in the Kurdistan province of Iran. Altogether, 14 landslide evaluation factors were input into the MLAs including slope, aspect, elevation, river density, distance to river, distance to fault, fault density, distance to road, road density, land use, slope curvature, lithology, stream power index (SPI), and topographic wetness index (TWI). We identified 64 locations of landslides by field survey of which 70% were randomly employed for building and training the three MLAs while the remaining locations were used for validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) reached a value of 0.94 for the decision tree compared to 0.82 for the random forest, and 0.75 for support vector machines model. Thus, the decision tree model was most accurate in identifying the areas at risk for future landslides. The obtained results may inform geoscientists and those in decision-making roles for landslide management."

However, the problem of sample imbalance in landslide susceptibility assessment, where landslide samples tend to be much smaller than non-landslide samples, is often overlooked. This problem is often one of the important factors affecting the performance of landslide susceptibility models. In this paper, we take the Wanzhou district of Chongqing city as an example, where the total number of data sets is more than 580,000 and the ratio of positive to negative samples is 1:19. We oversample or undersample the unbalanced landslide samples to make them balanced, and then compare the performance of machine learning models with different sampling strategies. Three classic machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, random forest and LightGBM, are used for LSA modeling. The results show that the model trained directly using the unbalanced sample dataset performs the worst, showing an extremely low recall rate, indicating that its predictive ability for landslide samples is extremely low and cannot be applied in practice. Compared with the original dataset, the sample set optimized through certain methods has demonstrated improved predictive performance across various classifiers, manifested in the improvement of AUC value and recall rate. The best model was the random forest model using over-sampling (O_RF) (AUC = 0.932)."

The Bailong River Basin (BRB) is a typical mountainous environment where regional debris flow disasters occur frequently, seriously threatening the lives of residents, infrastructure, and regional ecological security. However, there are few studies on the risk assessment of mountainous debris flow disasters in the BRB. By considering a complete catchment, based on remote sensing and GIS methods, we selected 17 influencing factors, such as area, average slope, lithology, NPP, average annual precipitation, landslide density, river density, fault density, etc. and applied a machine learning algorithm to establish a hazard assessment model. The analysis shows that the Extra Trees model is the most effective for debris flow hazard assessments, with an accuracy rate of 88%. Based on socio-economic data and debris flow disaster survey data, we established a vulnerability assessment model by applying the Contributing Weight Superposition method. We used the product of debris flow hazard and vulnerability to construct a debris flow risk assessment model. The catchments at a very high-risk were distributed mainly in the urban area of Wudu District and the northern part of Tanchang County, that is, areas with relatively dense economic activities and a high disaster frequency. These findings indicate that the assessment results provide scientific support for planning measures to prevent or reduce debris flow hazards. The proposed assessment methods can also be used to provide relevant guidance for a regional risk assessment of debris flows in the BRB and other regions."

The model uncertainty is explained in three ways: landslide susceptibility zoning result, risk area (high and extremely high) statistics, and the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC). The findings indicate that: (1) Landslides are restricted by influence factors and have the distribution law of relatively concentrated and strip-shaped distribution in space. (2) The percentage of real landslide in risk area is 86%, 87%, 82%, and 61% in SVM, RF, LR, and ANN, respectively.

Twelve evaluation factors, including elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, roughness, rainfall, lithology, distance to rivers, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index, topographic wetness index, plan curvature, and profile curvature, were extracted from 155 landslides in Yaozhou District, Tongchuan City, China. Six landslide susceptibility maps were generated based on the slope units divided by curvature and 30 m resolution grid units. Multiple performance metrics showed that the RS-RF model based on slope units has excellent spatial prediction ability.

It aims to record the location, size, and extent of landslides in each map scale. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), have been increasingly applied to landslide detection using remote sensing images in recent decades. However, their limitations have impeded their wide application. Furthermore, despite the widespread use of deep learning algorithms in remote sensing, for LIM, deep learning algorithms are limited to less unbalanced landslide samples. To this end, in this study, full convolution networks with focus loss (FCN-FL) were adopted to map historical landslides in regions with imbalanced samples using an improved symmetrically connected full convolution network and focus loss function to increase the feature level and reduce the contribution of the background loss value. In addition, K-fold cross-validation training models (FCN-FLK) were used to improve data utilization and model robustness. Results showed that the recall rate, F1-score, and mIoU of the model were improved by 0.08, 0.09, and 0.15, respectively, compared to FCN. It also demonstrated advantages over U-Net and SegNet.

Overall, seven models have reasonably good accuracy, ranging between 0.806 and 0.884. Furthermore, based on the best model, the study area is dominated by high susceptibility with an area coverage of 51%, which occurs in the areas with high slopes. This research is expected to improve the quality of landslide susceptibility maps in the study area as a foundation for mitigation planning. Furthermore, it can provide recommendations for further research in splitting ratio scenarios between training and testing data."

In this paper, various ML models, such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and deep learning neural network (DLNN) models were evaluated. Results of two validation methods (confusion matrix and ROC curve) show that the involvement of discontinuity-related variables significantly improved the landslide predictive capability of these four models. Their addition demonstrated a minimum of 6% and 4% increase in the overall prediction accuracy and the area under curve (AUC), respectively. In addition, frequency ratio (FR) analysis showed good consistency between landslide probability that was characterized by FR values and discontinuity-related variables, indicating a high correlation. Both results of model validation and FR analysis highlight that inclusion of discontinuities into ML models can improve landslide prediction accuracy."

During such events, great amounts of such socially generated data becomes available, which can be accessed and processed to extract situational awareness insights. These insights, in turn, can be used to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of disaster response in order to minimize the loss of lives and damage to property. People actively use social platforms like Facebook and Twitter to post information related to crisis events. Further, these platforms provide people the location and safety status of their family and friends during such events. Twitter, the microblogging platform, witnesses thousands of informally written tweets during crisis events, and since it provides high-level APIs to access its near real-time feed, it has become the primary source of data for researchers. It is generally observed that there is an exponential burst in the number of tweets during an ongoing crisis event. This sudden burst makes the task of monitoring, identifying, and processing each tweet virtually impossible for a human. However, such voluminous data can be processed using various machine learning and natural language processing techniques in coordination with a certain level of human interventions.

Therefore, in regions where multiple types of landslides coexist, it is required to separate landslide types for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). In this paper, a landslide-prone area located in Chongqing Province within the middle and upper reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA), China, was selected as the study area. 733 landslides were classified into three types: reservoir-affected landslides, non-reservoir-affected landslides, and rockfalls. Four landslide inventory datasets and 15 landslide conditional factors were trained by three Machine Learning models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine), and a Deep Learning (DL) model. After comparing the models using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), the landslide susceptibility indexes of three types landslides were acquired by the best performing model. These indexes were then used as input to generate the final map based on the Stacking method. The results revealed that DL model showed the best performance in LSM without considering landslide types, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.854 for testing and 0.922 for training. Moreover, when we separated the landslide types for LSM, the AUC improved by 0.026 for testing and 0.044 for training. Thus, this paper demonstrates that considering different landslide types in LSM can significantly improve the quality of landslide susceptibility maps. These maps in turn, can be valuable tools for evaluating and mitigating landslide hazards."

In this study, Scoops 3D (a three-dimensional slope stability analysis tool) was utilized to conduct a qualitative assessment of slope stability in the Yunyang section of the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The depth of the bedrock was predicted utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), incorporating local boreholes and building on the insights from prior research. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was subsequently used to execute a data-driven landslide susceptibility analysis. The proposed methodology demonstrated a notable increase of 29.25% in the evaluation metric, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), outperforming the prevailing benchmark model. Furthermore, the landslide susceptibility map generated by the proposed model demonstrated superior interpretability. This result not only validates the effectiveness of amalgamating mathematical and mechanistic insights for such analyses, but it also carries substantial academic and practical implications."

Therefore, effective monitoring of rainfall is crucial in hazard management and ecosystem assessment. Global precipitation measurement (GPM) is the next-generation satellite mission, which provides the precipitation measurements worldwide. In this research, we employed the available monthly GPM data to estimate the monthly precipitation for the twenty administrative regions of Italy from June 2000 to June 2021. For each region, we applied the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test and its associated Sen's slope to estimate the precipitation trend for each calendar month. In addition, for each region, we estimated a linear trend and the seasonal cycles of precipitation with the antileakage least-squares spectral analysis (ALLSSA) and showed the annual precipitation variations using box plots. Lastly, we compared machine-learning models based on the auto-regressive moving average for monthly precipitation forecasting and showed that ALLSSA outperformed them. The findings of this research provide a significant insight into processing climate data, both in terms of trend-season estimates and forecasting, and can potentially be used in landslide susceptibility analysis."

Extracting landslide information quickly and accurately is the basis of landslide disaster prevention. Fengjie County, Chongqing, China, is a typical landslide-prone area in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. In this study, we newly integrate Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) and Optuna (OPT) hyperparameter tuning into four basic machine learning algorithms: Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Additive Boosting (AdaBoost). We construct four new models (SHAP-OPT-GBDT, SHAP-OPT-XGBoost, SHAP-OPT-LightGBM, and SHAP-OPT-AdaBoost) and apply the four new models to landslide extraction for the first time. Firstly, high-resolution remote sensing images were preprocessed, landslide and non-landslide samples were constructed, and an initial feature set with 48 features was built. Secondly, SHAP was used to select features with significant contributions, and the important features were selected. Finally, Optuna, the Bayesian optimization technique, was utilized to automatically select the basic models’ best hyperparameters. The experimental results show that the accuracy (ACC) of these four SHAP-OPT models was above 92% and the training time was less than 1.3 s using mediocre computational hardware. Furthermore, SHAP-OPT-XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (96.26%). Landslide distribution information in Fengjie County from 2013 to 2020 can be extracted by SHAP-OPT-XGBoost accurately and quickly."
A Comparative Study of Shallow Machine Learning Models and Deep Learning Models for Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Based on Imbalanced Data,"Shiluo Xu, Yingxu Song, Xiulan Hao",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/f13111908,https://openalex.org/W4309210525,"A landslide is a type of geological disaster that poses a threat to human lives and property. Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) is a crucial tool for landslide prevention. This paper’s primary objective is to compare the performances of conventional shallow machine learning methods and deep learning methods in LSA based on imbalanced data to evaluate the applicability of the two types of LSA models when class-weighted strategies are applied. In this article, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural network (DFCNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were employed for modeling in the Zigui-Badong area of the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China. Eighteen landslide influence factors were introduced to compare the performance of four models under a class balanced strategy versus a class imbalanced strategy. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) was applied for factor correlation analysis. The results reveal that the elevation and distance to rivers play a dominant role in LSA tasks. It was observed that DFCNN (AUC = 0.87, F1-score = 0.60) and LSTM (AUC = 0.89, F1-score = 0.61) significantly outperformed LR (AUC = 0.89, F1-score = 0.50) and RF (AUC = 0.88, F1-score = 0.50) under the class imbalanced strategy. The RF model achieved comparable outcomes (AUC = 0.90, F1-score = 0.61) to deep learning models under the class balanced strategy and ran at a faster training speed (up to 63 times faster than deep learning models). The LR model performance was inferior to that of the other three models under the balanced strategy. Meanwhile, the deep learning models and the shallow machine learning models showed significant differences in susceptibility spatial patterns. This paper’s findings will aid researchers in selecting appropriate LSA models. It is also valuable for land management policy making and disaster prevention and mitigation."

Landslides occur in hilly and mountainous areas all over the world. Single, ensemble, and hybrid machine learning (ML) models have been used in landslide studies for better landslide susceptibility mapping and risk management. In the present study, we have used three single ML models, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), and radial basis function network (RBFN), for landslide susceptibility mapping at Pithoragarh district, as these models are easy to apply and so far they have not been used for landslide study in this area. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of these single models for correctly identifying landslide susceptible zones for their further application in other areas. For this, ten important landslide affecting factors, namely, slope, aspect, curvature, elevation, land cover, lithology, geomorphology, distance to rivers, distance to roads, and overburden depth based on the local geoenvironmental conditions, were considered for the modeling. Landslide inventory of past 398 landslide events was used in the development of models. The data of past landslide events (locations) was randomly divided into a 70/30 ratio for training (70%) and validation (30%) of the models. Standard statistical measures, namely, accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPF), sensitivity (SST), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results indicated that the performance of all the models is very good (AUC &gt; 0.90) and that of the LR model is the best (AUC = 0.926). Therefore, these single ML models can be used for the development of accurate landslide susceptibility maps. Our study demonstrated that the single models which are easy to use and can compete with the complex ensemble/hybrid models can be applied for landslide susceptibility mapping in landslide‐prone areas."

This work presents the performance of five machine learning methods—k-nearest neighbor (KNN), stochastic gradient descendent (SGD), support vector machine radial basis function (SVM RBF Kernel), support vector machine (SVM linear kernel), and AdaBoost—in landslide detection in a zone of the state of Guerrero in southern Mexico, using continuous change maps and primary landslide factors, such as slope angle, terrain orientation (aspect), and lithology, as inputs. The models were trained with 2/3 of ground truth samples of 671 slidden/non-slidden polygons. The obtained inventory maps were evaluated with the remaining 1/3 of ground truth samples by generating a confusion matrix and applying the Kappa concordance coefficient, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics, as well as omission and commission errors. According to the results, the AdaBoost classifier reached greater spatial and statistical coherence than the other implemented methods. The best input layer combination for detection was the continuous change maps obtained by the linear regression and image differencing detection methods, together with the slope angle, aspect, and lithology conditioning factors."

Accurate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is crucial for sustainable development. Machine learning has recently become an important means of LSM. However, the accuracy of machine learning models is limited by the heterogeneity of environmental factors and the imbalance of samples, especially for large-scale LSM. To address these problems, we created an improved random forest (RF)-based LSM model and applied it to Guangdong Province, China. First, the RF-based LSM model was constructed using rainfall-induced landslide samples and 13 environmental factors and by exploring the optimal positive-to-negative and training-to-test sample ratios. Second, the performance of the RF-based LSM model was evaluated and compared with three other machine learning models. The results indicate that: (1) the proposed RF-based model has the best performance with the highest area under curve (AUC) of 0.9145, based on optimal positive-to-negative and training-to-test sample ratios of 1:1 and 8:2, respectively; (2) the introduction of rainfall and global human modification (GHM) can increase the AUC from 0.8808 to 0.9145; and (3) rainfall and topography are two dominant factors in Guangdong landslides. These findings can facilitate landslide risk prevention and serve as a technical reference for large-scale accurate LSM."

A spatial database of 19 conditioning factors related to the occurrence of a landslide was constructed to develop the landslide susceptibility maps. Thereafter, three models were estimated and compared using metrics such as accuracy, recall, F 1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Soil thickness is found to play a significant role in the occurrence of a landslide. The quantitative analysis of landslide susceptibility maps indicates the superiority of the random forest model. Finally, the outcomes of the random forest model incorporating multicollinearity analysis and factor selection were thoroughly discussed. In conclusion, the random forest is the recommended algorithm for evaluating landslide susceptibility to aid in disaster management in Wushan County."

The earthquake initiated a series of catastrophic landslides (classified as flowslides) [1,2], collapsed buildings, and generated tsunami waves that impacted Palu Bay's coast. The earthquake claimed over 4000 lives, making it the deadliest natural disaster of 2018. We performed a post-earthquake field reconnaissance and collected perishable data at the sites of five significant flowslides (named for the communities where they occurred: Balaroa, Petobo, Lolu Village, Jono Oge, and Sibalaya), as well as at other damage locations in the mesoseismal region. Our field team consisted of five U.S.-based members, who were sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation-supported Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) organization [3], in collaboration with geologists, geotechnical engineers, and other researchers from Indonesia's Center for Earthquake Studies (PusGen) and the Indonesian Society of Geotechnical Engineers (HATTI) [this international team is collectively referred to as the Palu Earthquake "";GEER"" team]. The GEER team arrived at Palu City on 13 November 2018 and conducted five days of extensive fieldwork using instrumentation from the Natural Hazards Reconnaissance Facility (known as the ""RAPID"") [4,5], including mobile data collection software, digital imaging systems, high-resolution Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antennas, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or "";drones""). The resulting dataset includes over 2000 geotagged photographs, UAV images, ground coordinates, and other field measurements and observations, as well as associated post-processed geospatial data products (point clouds, digital surface models, orthomosaic images). Additionally, we used remote sensing data (i.e., pre- and post-event satellite imagery) to generate displacement vectors for over 1200 structures affected by the flowslides. The complete reconnaissance dataset is openly available on DesignSafe [6]. The data collected by the field team and subsequent mapping efforts, which document the morphology and patterns of movements of the flowslides, may be used by researchers studying liquefaction-induced flowslides. In addition, the displacement mapping provides a unique dataset for researchers who are calibrating and verifying simulation models of landslide displacements, or who are seeking a validation dataset for image correlation analysis (including machine learning routines). This dataset is associated with original research presented in "";East Palu Valley Flowslides Induced by the 2018 MW 7.5 Palu-Donggala Earthquake"" [1] and also is the basis of research presented by Gallant et al.

However, the extensive amount of labeled training data required by machine learning, particularly the precise negative data (i.e., non-landslide area), cannot be easily and efficiently collected. To address this issue, this study presents a one-class-classifier-based negative data generation method for rapid earthquake-induced LSM. First, an incomplete landslide inventory (i.e., positive data) was produced with the aid of change detection using before-and-after satellite images and the Geographic Information System (GIS). Second, a one-class classifier was utilized to compute the probability of landslide occurrence based on the incomplete landslide inventory followed by the negative data generation from the low landslide susceptibility areas. Third, the positive data as well as the generated negative data (i.e., non-landslide) were compounded to train a traditional binary classifier to produce the final LSM. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is capable of achieving a result that is comparable to methods using the complete landslide inventory, and it displays good correspondence with recent landslide events, making it a suitable method for rapid earthquake-induced LSM. The findings in this study would be useful in regional disaster planning and risk reduction."

Dense networks of sensors, named rain gauges (RGs), are typically used to obtain direct measurements of precipitation intensity in these points. These measurements are usually interpolated by using spatial interpolation methods for estimating the precipitation field over the entire area of interest. However, these methods are computationally expensive, and to improve the estimation of the variable of interest in unknown points, it is necessary to integrate further information. To overcome these issues, this work proposes a machine learning-based methodology that exploits a classifier based on ensemble methods for rainfall estimation and is able to integrate information from different remote sensing measurements. The proposed approach supplies an accurate estimate of the rainfall where RGs are not available, permits the integration of heterogeneous data sources exploiting both the high quantitative precision of RGs and the spatial pattern recognition ensured by radars and satellites, and is computationally less expensive than the interpolation methods. Experimental results, conducted on real data concerning an Italian region, Calabria, show a significant improvement in comparison with Kriging with external drift (KED), a well-recognized method in the field of rainfall estimation, both in terms of the probability of detection (0.58 versus 0.48) and mean-square error (0.11 versus 0.15)."

Moreover, the stability of reservoir banks changes with the long-term dynamics of external disaster-causing factors. Thus, assessing the time-varying reliability of reservoir landslides remains a challenge. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) based approach is proposed to analyze the long-term reliability of reservoir bank landslides in spatially variable soils through time series prediction. This study systematically investigated the prediction performances of three ML algorithms, i.e. multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Additionally, the effects of the data quantity and data ratio on the predictive power of deep learning models are considered. The results show that all three ML models can accurately depict the changes in the time-varying failure probability of reservoir landslides. The CNN model outperforms both the MLP and LSTM models in predicting the failure probability. Furthermore, selecting the right data ratio can improve the prediction accuracy of the failure probability obtained by ML models."

In conclusion, the RDC method can extract the more representative features from environmental factors and outperform the other conventional discretization methods."
Understanding Landslide Susceptibility in Northern Chilean Patagonia: A Basin-Scale Study Using Machine Learning and Field Data,"Elizabet Lizama, Bastían Morales, Marcelo Somos‐Valenzuela, Ningsheng Chen, Mei Liu",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14040907,https://openalex.org/W4212903034,"The interaction of geological processes and climate changes has resulted in growing landslide activity that has impacted communities and ecosystems in northern Chilean Patagonia. On 17 December 2017, a catastrophic flood of 7 × 106 m3 almost destroyed Villa Santa Lucía and approximately 3 km of the southern highway (Route 7), the only land route in Chilean Patagonia that connects this vast region from north to south, exposing the vulnerability of the population and critical infrastructure to these natural hazards. The 2017 flood produced a paradigm shift on the analysis scale to understand the danger to which communities and their infrastructure are exposed. Thus, in this study, we sought to evaluate the susceptibility of landslides in the Yelcho and Rio Frio basins, whose intersection represents the origin of this great flood. For this, we used two approaches, (1) geospatial data in combination with machine learning methods using different training configurations and (2) a qualitative analysis of the landscape considering the geological and geomorphological conditions through fieldwork. For statistical modeling, we used an inventory of landslides that occurred between 2008 and 2017 and a total of 17 predictive variables, which are geoenvironmental, climatological and environmental triggers derived from volcanic and seismic activity. Our results indicate that soil moisture significantly impacted spatial susceptibility, followed by lithology, drainage density and seismic activity. Additionally, we observed that the inclusion of climatic predictors and environmental triggers increased the average performance score of the models by up to 3–5%. Based on our results, we believe that the wide distribution of volcanic–sedimentary rocks hydrothermally altered with zeolites in the western mountains of the Yelcho and Rio Frio basin are highly susceptible to generating large-scale landslides. Therefore, the town of Villa Santa Lucia and the “Carretera Austral” (Route 7) are susceptible to new landslides coming mainly from the western slope. This requires the timely implementation of measures to mitigate the impact on the population and critical infrastructure."

In this study, we propose a hybrid machine learning model based on a rotation forest (RoF) meta classifier and a random forest (RF) decision tree classifier called RoFRF for landslide prediction in a mountainous area near Kamyaran city, Kurdistan Province, Iran. We used 118 landslide locations and 25 conditioning factors from which their predictive usefulness was measured using the chi-square technique in a 10-fold cross-validation analysis. We used the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-measure, Kappa, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to validate the performance of the proposed model compared to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Best First Tree (BFT), and RF models. The validation results demonstrated that the landslide susceptibility map produced by the hybrid model had the highest goodness-of-fit (AUC = 0.953) and higher prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.919) compared to the benchmark models. The hybrid RoFRF model proposed in this study can be used as a robust predictive model for landslide susceptibility mapping in the mountainous regions around the world."

In view of the problems of the existing landslide hazard susceptibility evaluation model, such as poor effectiveness and inaccuracy of landslide hazard data and the need for experts to participate in the calculation of a large number of evaluation factor weight classification statistics. In this paper, a combined SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subsets-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and PSO-RF (Particle Swarm Optimization-Random Forest) algorithm was proposed to evaluate the susceptibility of landslide hazards in complex mountainous regions characterized by frequent earthquakes, deep river valleys, and large terrain height differences. First, the SBAS-InSAR technique was used to invert the surface deformation rates of the study area and identified potential landslide hazards. Second, the study area was divided into 412,585 grid cells, and the 16 selected environmental factors were analyzed comprehensively to identify the most effective evaluation factors. Last, 2722 landslide (1361 grid cells) and non-landslide (1361 grid cells) grid cells in the study area were randomly divided into a training dataset (70%) and a test dataset (30%). By analyzing real landslide and non-landslide data, the performances of the PSO-RF algorithm and three other machine learning algorithms, BP (back propagation), SVM (support vector machines), and RF (random forest) algorithms were compared. The results showed that 329 potential landslide hazards were updated using the surface deformation rates and existing landslide cataloguing data. Furthermore, the area under the curve (AUC) value and the accuracy (ACC) of the PSO-RF algorithm were 0.9567 and 0.8874, which were higher than those of the BP (0.8823 and 0.8274), SVM (0.8910 and 0.8311), and RF (0.9293 and 0.8531), respectively. In conclusion, the method put forth in this paper can be effectively updated landslide data sources and implemented a susceptibility prediction assessment of landslide disasters in intricate mountainous areas. The findings can serve as a strong reference for the prevention of landslide hazards and decision-making mitigation by government departments."

This study aims to comprehensively compare multiple models, including linear, nonlinear, and ensemble models, based on 5281 historical landslides in southwest China, the area most severely affected by the landslide disaster. Linear models represented by logistic regression (LR), nonlinear models represented by support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and classification 5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT), and ensemble models represented by random forest (RF) and categorical boosting (Catboost) were selected. The correlation coefficient, variance inflation factor (VIF), and relative important analysis were used to select the dominate landslide conditioning factors. Using multiple statistical indicators (e.g. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and Kappa), cross-validation and qualitative methods to evaluate the models' performance. The findings are: (1) Regarding the model predictive performance, the best predictive performance was demonstrated by the ensemble models Catboost (AUC = 0.823 and Kappa = 0.593) and RF (AUC = 0.821 and Kappa = 0.582), followed by the nonlinear models SVM (AUC = 0.775 and Kappa = 0.520), ANN (AUC = 0.770 and Kappa = 0.486) and C5.0 DT (AUC = 0.751 and Kappa = 0.497), while the linear model LR (AUC = 0.756 and Kappa = 0.456) had a more limited performance. The ensemble model, which uses a tree as its baseline classifier, has a lot of potential for studies into the landslide susceptibility. (2) Regarding the model robustness, the three types of models in nonspatial cross-validation (CV) performed relatively similarly in terms of predictive power, while in spatial cross-validation (SPCV), the linear model LR (median AUC = 0.714) achieved better results than the ensemble and nonlinear models. It implies that when the distribution of landslides is not homogeneous, linear models may be the most robust. It is advisable to consider various evaluation metrics from different perspectives and integrate them with specialist qualitative geomorphological empirical knowledge to determine the best model. (3) The Gini index-based RF model suggests that road density was the dominant factor in the frequency of landslides in the study area."

Making landslide as one of the catastrophes with the greatest risk of loss and leaving a couple regions prone to landslides in Indonesia, Pacitan region is one of them. Landslide delineation therefore represents a particularly beneficial application of evolving research trend in disaster reduction, especially for the vulnerable region. In the present times of open-access satellite data, cloud computing and machine-learning algorithms is frequently used for disaster prevention monitoring. By employing Google Earth Engine, this study focuses on the susceptibility of landslide occurrence using a random forest machine-learning framework applied to digital topographic data such as elevation, slope and aspect as the independent variables and landslide inventory data obtained from Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Republic of Indonesia as the dependent variable. This study data sets composed from 1000 random points in Pacitan region with 70:30 ratio for training and testing sample points.

One of those problems is the classification of tweets due to use of sophisticated and complex language, which makes the current tools insufficient. We present our framework HTwitt, built on top of the Hadoop ecosystem, which consists of a MapReduce algorithm and a set of machine learning techniques embedded within a big data analytics platform to efficiently address the following problems: (1) traditional data processing techniques are inadequate to handle big data; (2) data preprocessing needs substantial manual effort; (3) domain knowledge is required before the classification; (4) semantic explanation is ignored. In this work, these challenges are overcome by using different algorithms combined with a Naïve Bayes classifier to ensure reliability and highly precise recommendations in virtualization and cloud environments. These features make HTwitt different from others in terms of having an effective and practical design for text classification in big data analytics. The main contribution of the paper is to propose a framework for building landslide early warning systems by pinpointing useful tweets and visualizing them along with the processed information. We demonstrate the results of the experiments which quantify the levels of overfitting in the training stage of the model using different sizes of real-world datasets in machine learning phases.

Landslide susceptibility assessment of South Korea using stacking ensemble machine learning,"Seungmin Lee, Seung Jae Lee",2024,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40677-024-00271-y,https://openalex.org/W4391743610,"Abstract Background Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) is a crucial indicator of landslide hazards, and its accuracy is improving with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. However, the AI algorithms are inconsistent across regions and strongly dependent on input variables. Additionally, LSA must include historical data, which often restricts the assessment to the local scale and single landslide events. Methods In this study, we performed an LSA for the entirety of South Korea. A total of 30 input variables were constructed, consisting of 9 variables from past climate model data MK-PRISM, 12 topographical factors, and 9 environmental factors. Sixteen machine learning algorithms were used as basic classifiers, and a stacking ensemble was used on the four algorithms with the highest area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, a separate assessment model was established for areas with a risk of landslides affecting areas larger than 1 ha. Results The highest-performing classifier was CatBoost, with an AUC of ~ 0.89 for both assessments. Among the input variables, distance of road, daily maximum precipitation, digital elevation model, and soil depth were the most influential. In all landslide events, CatBoost, lightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest had the highest AUC in descending order; in large landslide events, the order was CatBoost, XGBoost, Extra Tree, and lightGBM. The stacking ensemble enabled the construction of two landslide susceptibility maps. Conclusions Our findings provide a statistical method for constructing a high-resolution (30 m) landslide susceptibility map on a country scale using diverse natural factors, including past climate data."
Effects of non-landslide sampling strategies on machine learning models in landslide susceptibility mapping,"Tengfei Gu, Ping Duan, Mingguo Wang, Jia Li, Yanke Zhang",2024,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-57964-5,https://openalex.org/W4393180748,"Abstract This study aims to explore the effects of different non-landslide sampling strategies on machine learning models in landslide susceptibility mapping. Non-landslide samples are inherently uncertain, and the selection of non-landslide samples may suffer from issues such as noisy or insufficient regional representations, which can affect the accuracy of the results. In this study, a positive-unlabeled (PU) bagging semi-supervised learning method was introduced for non-landslide sample selection. In addition, buffer control sampling (BCS) and K-means (KM) clustering were applied for comparative analysis. Based on landslide data from Qiaojia County, Yunnan Province, China, collected in 2014, three machine learning models, namely, random forest, support vector machine, and CatBoost, were used for landslide susceptibility mapping. The results show that the quality of samples selected using different non-landslide sampling strategies varies significantly. Overall, the quality of non-landslide samples selected using the PU bagging method is superior, and this method performs best when combined with CatBoost for predicting (AUC = 0.897) landslides in very high and high susceptibility zones (82.14%). Additionally, the KM results indicated overfitting, displaying high accuracy for validation but poor statistical outcomes for zoning. The BCS results were the worst."

Firstly, multiple MLMs were selected and hyperparameters were optimized, and the generated 11 models were cross-integrated to select the best model to calculate landslide susceptibility; by calculating precipitation for different extreme precipitation recurrence periods and combining the susceptibility results to assess the landslide hazard. Using the town as the basic unit, the exposure and vulnerability of the future landslide population under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios in each town were assessed, and then combined with the hazard to estimate the LPAR in 2050. The results showed that the integrated model with the optimized random forest model as the combination strategy had the best comprehensive performance in susceptibility assessment. The distribution of hazard classes is similar to susceptibility, and with an increase in precipitation, the low-hazard area and high-hazard decrease and shift to medium-hazard and very high-hazard classes. The high-risk areas for future landslide populations in Shuicheng County are mainly concentrated in the three southwestern towns with high vulnerability, whereas the northern towns of Baohua and Qinglin are at the lowest risk class. The LPAR increased with the intensity of extreme precipitation. The LPAR differs significantly among the SSPs scenarios, with the lowest in the ""fossil-fueled development (SSP5)"" scenario and the highest in the ""regional rivalry (SSP3)"" scenario. In summary, the landslide susceptibility model based on integrated machine learning proposed in this study has a high predictive capability. The results of future LPAR assessment can provide theoretical guidance for relevant departments to cope with future socioeconomic development challenges and make corresponding disaster prevention and mitigation plans to prevent landslide risks from a developmental perspective."

The XGboost algorithm uses a multi-parameter indices function as an input, namely Slope, Aspect, Curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), Rainfall and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These indices were systematically investigated using ALOS PALSAR DEM image (12.5m resolution), rainfall from WorldClim data and Landsat-5 data for NDVI mapping. Initially, the hierarchical selection of the causative factors was carried out within the XGBoost algorithm, which revealed the variable importance of each causative factor to be used for the parameterization of the landslide potential index (LPI). LPI mapping indicated five different classes of landslide zonation, which were tested using the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. The AUC (Area under the curve) yielded a value of 0.91, indicating a robust performance of the ROC in terms of a true positive rate. A significantly larger spatial extent of the study area was found in moderate to high zones along the road, indicating the potential impact of governing causative factors of landslide vulnerability."
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Based on Deep Learning Algorithms Using Information Value Analysis Optimization,"Junjie Ji, Yongzhang Zhou, Qiuming Cheng, Shoujun Jiang, Shiting Liu",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/land12061125,https://openalex.org/W4378229377,"Selecting samples with non-landslide attributes significantly impacts the deep-learning modeling of landslide susceptibility mapping. This study presents a method of information value analysis in order to optimize the selection of negative samples used for machine learning. Recurrent neural network (RNN) has a memory function, so when using an RNN for landslide susceptibility mapping purposes, the input order of the landslide-influencing factors affects the resulting quality of the model. The information value analysis calculates the landslide-influencing factors, determines the input order of data based on the importance of any specific factor in determining the landslide susceptibility, and improves the prediction potential of recurrent neural networks. The simple recurrent unit (SRU), a newly proposed variant of the recurrent neural network, is characterized by possessing a faster processing speed and currently has less application history in landslide susceptibility mapping. This study used recurrent neural networks optimized by information value analysis for landslide susceptibility mapping in Xinhui District, Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, China. Four models were constructed: the RNN model with optimized negative sample selection, the SRU model with optimized negative sample selection, the RNN model, and the SRU model. The results show that the RNN model with optimized negative sample selection has the best performance in terms of AUC value (0.9280), followed by the SRU model with optimized negative sample selection (0.9057), the RNN model (0.7277), and the SRU model (0.6355). In addition, several objective measures of accuracy (0.8598), recall (0.8302), F1 score (0.8544), Matthews correlation coefficient (0.7206), and the receiver operating characteristic also show that the RNN model performs the best. Therefore, the information value analysis can be used to optimize negative sample selection in landslide sensitivity mapping in order to improve the model’s performance; second, SRU is a weaker method than RNN in terms of model performance."
A XGBoost-Based Downscaling-Calibration Scheme for Extreme Precipitation Events,"Honglin Zhu, Huizeng Liu, Qiming Zhou, Aihong Cui",2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/tgrs.2023.3294266,https://openalex.org/W4383960224,"Extreme precipitation events have caused severe societal, economic and environmental impacts through the disasters of floods, flash-floods and landslides. However, the coarse-resolution of satellite-derived precipitation data makes it difficult to quantitatively capture certain fine-scale heavy rainfall process. Therefore, to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of satellite-based precipitation extremes, a downscaling-calibration scheme based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost_DC) was proposed in this study, where the XGBoost algorithm was applied in both downscaling and calibration procedures. The performance of XGBoost_DC was evaluated with other two comparative methods, in which XGBoost was only used in either downscaling (XGBoost_Spline) or calibration (Spline_XGBoost) process. The results showed that: (i) XGBoost_DC achieved the best performance, as it obtained the highest accuracy and well reproduced the occurrence and the spatial distribution of precipitation during typhoon events. (ii) XGBoost_DC could capture the spatial variations of the precipitation. Although Spline_XGBoost obtained results only slightly worse than the XGBoost_DC, it significantly underestimated the spatial variability. (iii) the model assessment between the XGBoost_DC and Spline_XGBoost illustrated the essential contribution of XGBoost algorithm in downscaling process, and improved our understanding of the capability of machine learning algorithm in reproducing spatial variance of precipitation. These findings imply that our proposed downscaling-calibration scheme can be applied for generating high-resolution and high-quality precipitation extremes during typhoon events, which would benefit the water and flood management, as well as other various applications in hydrological and meteorological modelling."

We account for environmental, societal, and economic factors to predict the number of displaced persons per event in the affected regions. Here we show that displacements can be primarily attributed to the combination of poor household conditions and intense precipitation, as revealed through the interpretation of the trained models using both Shapley values and causality-based methods. We hence provide empirical evidence that differential or uneven vulnerability exists and provide a means for its quantification, which could help advance evidence-based mitigation and adaptation planning efforts."
Using Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Gated Recurrent Unit to Predict Landslide Displacements in Dam Reservoir,"Beibei Yang, Ting Xiao, Luqi Wang, Wei Huang",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22041320,https://openalex.org/W4211177084,"It is crucial to predict landslide displacement accurately for establishing a reliable early warning system. Such a requirement is more urgent for landslides in the reservoir area. The main reason is that an inaccurate prediction can lead to riverine disasters and secondary surge disasters. Machine learning (ML) methods have been developed and commonly applied in landslide displacement prediction because of their powerful nonlinear processing ability. Recently, deep ML methods have become popular, as they can deal with more complicated problems than conventional ML methods. However, it is usually not easy to obtain a well-trained deep ML model, as many hyperparameters need to be trained. In this paper, a deep ML method-the gated recurrent unit (GRU)-with the advantages of a powerful prediction ability and fewer hyperparameters, was applied to forecast landslide displacement in the dam reservoir. The accumulated displacement was firstly decomposed into a trend term, a periodic term, and a stochastic term by complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD). A univariate GRU model and a multivariable GRU model were employed to forecast trend and stochastic displacements, respectively. A multivariable GRU model was applied to predict periodic displacement, and another two popular ML methods-long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) and random forest (RF)-were used for comparison. Precipitation, reservoir level, and previous displacement were considered to be candidate-triggering factors for inputs of the models. The Baijiabao landslide, located in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), was taken as a case study to test the prediction ability of the model. The results demonstrated that the GRU algorithm provided the most encouraging results. Such a satisfactory prediction accuracy of the GRU algorithm depends on its ability to fully use the historical information while having fewer hyperparameters to train. It is concluded that the proposed model can be a valuable tool for predicting the displacements of landslides in the TGRA and other dam reservoirs."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Based on High-Trust Non-Landslide Point Selection,"Yizhun Zhang, Qisheng Yan",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11070398,https://openalex.org/W4285394480,"Landslide susceptibility prediction has the disadvantages of being challenging to apply to expanding landslide samples and the low accuracy of a subjective random selection of non-landslide samples. Taking Fu’an City, Fujian Province, as an example, a model based on a semi-supervised framework using particle swarm optimization to optimize extreme learning machines (SS-PSO-ELM) is proposed. Based on the landslide samples, a semi-supervised learning framework is constructed through Density Peak Clustering (DPC), Frequency Ratio (FR), and Random Forest (RF) models to expand and divide the landslide sample data. The landslide susceptibility was predicted using high-trust sample data as the input variables of the data-driven model. The results show that the area under the curve (AUC) valued at the SS-PSO-ELM model for landslide susceptibility prediction is 0.893 and the root means square error (RMSE) is 0.370, which is better than ELM and PSO-ELM models without the semi-supervised framework. It shows that the SS-PSO-ELM model is more effective in landslide susceptibility. Thus, it provides a new research idea for predicting landslide susceptibility."

The Himalayan terrains are highly susceptible to different natural hazards as well as disasters particularly land failure activities mainly due to inherent tectonic activities which further enhanced by various Neo-tectonic and Neolithic activities. This scientific study provides an enhanced framework for the assessment of proper and precise landslide susceptibility in the two districts of Arunachal Pradesh (Tawang and West Kameng) considering both physical and anthropogenic factors and various machine learning models (SVM, AdaBoost and XGBoost). At first, landslide inventory maps were developed based on previous landslide events. Here, 70% of the data were randomly selected for training and remaining was used for validation and optimization of the models using statistical implications and validation assessment methods. The result showed that the high and very high landslide susceptible areas are mainly concentrated in the middle portion along the Bhalukpong-Bomdia road section. Based on the AUC value and other statistical indicators it has been observed that AdaBoost is the most efficient model here (AUC = 0.92). AUC values of SVM and XGBoost are 0.85 and 0.89 respectively. AdaBoost model identifies that very low susceptibility class occupies 60.22% area and very high landslide susceptibility class occupies 15.51% area and it will be considered as more encouraging method for landslide susceptibility determination in this kind of cases for better accurateness. This high accuracy susceptibility map positively helps during the execution of various developmental projects."

The results show that the SOM-OCSVM method achieves the highest AUC (&amp;gt;0.94) and minimum standard deviation (&amp;lt;0.081) compared with other methods. Moreover, RF achieves the best performance in different datasets compared with other ML models. The aforementioned results prove that the proposed method can enhance the performance of ML models to produce more reliable LSM."
A data‐driven intelligent model for landslide displacement prediction,"Qi Ge, Hongyue Sun, Zhongqiang Liu, Xu Wang",2023,https://doi.org/10.1002/gj.4675,https://openalex.org/W4316590469,"Landslides with step‐like deformation features are widely distributed in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGR) of China, posing a severe hazard to the inhabitants of this region. This paper proposes a multi‐input and multi‐output intelligent integrated displacement prediction model for landslides with step‐like displacement patterns. In this new model, three interconnected and information‐transmitted functional sub‐models are integrated. Unsupervised learning is used to identify different landslide deformation states automatically, and the imbalance classification and explainable artificial intelligence techniques are introduced for qualitative prediction and information filtering. Probability theory and deep machine learning are adopted to provide deterministically predicted values and quantify their uncertainty. The case study of the Baijiabao landslide in the TGR region proves that the proposed model performs satisfactorily in both point and interval predictions. The intelligent integrated model can also provide the forecast of landslide deformation states, visual input information filtering and back analysis of influencing factors, which are valuable to landslide early warning and risk management."

In this study, we have tried to develop a semi-automated detection methodology applying concepts of GeoBIA on High-Resolution Earth Observation imagery acquired from an Uncrewed Aerial Systems also referred to as Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The study area is in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, India. The UAV was flown over a landslide site. The UAV data was processed for deriving photogrammetric products (Digital Elevation Model and Orthomosaic). The methodology implements the segmentation and classification of UAV images using Multi-otsu thresholding method and machine learning algorithm of random forest. It incorporates spectral (RGB), textural (GLCM entropy and GLCM angular second moment), morphological (sky view factor), and topographical (elevation, slope, curvature) features derived from UAV photogrammetric products. When determining landslide locations is of utmost concern, this system's ability to detect landslides quickly and effectively gives it a viable alternative to manual procedures for landslide mapping across wide areas. The developed system was able to detect 86% of the total landslide area."
Improvement of the predictive performance of landslide mapping models in mountainous terrains using cluster sampling,"Muhammad Tayyib Riaz, Muhammad Basharat, Quoc Bao Pham, Yasir Sarfraz, Amir Shahzad, Khawaja Shoaib Ahmed, Nawaz Ikram, Muhammad Waseem",2022,https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2066202,https://openalex.org/W4224269274,"Landslide predictive performance is expected to vary with different sampling techniques, such as landslide random and cluster sampling. Current advancements in remote sensing technologies and machine learning (ML) have enhanced landslide prediction performance. The Himalayan Mountain range in Pakistan poses an unadorned threat to the ecosystem and valley population because of landslide occurrence. The present study explores, and tests alternative sampling technique based on spatial pattern characterization in the wake of increased landslide prediction efficacy, rather than a renowned random technique for training and testing sampling. Thereupon, landslide inventory data with 17 geo-environmental factors (i.e. topographic, hydrological and seismic factors) were determined. Landslide cluster patterns were confirmed by the Nearest Neighbor Index (NNI) method and after getting the cluster patterns, the predicted performance of landslide sampling was tested using ML and statistical methods. Advanced ML algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) and statistical methods including Weight-of-Evidence (WofE) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used and validated. The landslide-prone district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (Neelum Valley), Kashmir Himalayas, Pakistan, was selected as a case study. Prediction performance rates are high with area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.802 to 0.912; accuracy (ACC) ranges from 0.78 to 0.89, and kappa ranges from 0.50 to 0.68 with cluster sampling technique, whereas the performance was low with random sampling technique, with AUC ranges from 0.768 to 0.895; ACC ranges from 0.74 to 0.86 and kappa ranges from 0.48 to 0.64. The descending order of accuracy of the six algorithms was XGboost, RF, KNN, NB, LR and WofE. Our results confirmed that the landslides followed cluster patterns in the study area, and ML algorithms with cluster training samples positively affected landslide susceptibility prediction with a statistically significant difference. The outcomes support the hypothesis that using landslides spatial natural existence, as training samples, instead of random concepts, improves the prediction ability; and highlights that alternative landslide partitioning technique could be a practicable and robust choice for landslides prediction modelling."
Integrating the artificial intelligence and hybrid machine learning algorithms for improving the accuracy of spatial prediction of landslide hazards in Kurseong Himalayan Region,"Anik Saha, Sunil Saha",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aiig.2022.06.002,https://openalex.org/W4283277975,"The aim of the current work is to compare susceptibility maps of landslides produced using machine learning techniques i.e. multilayer perception neural nets (MLP), kernel logistic regression (KLR), random forest (RF), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS); novel ensemble approaches i.e. MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, RF-Bagging and MARS-Bagging in the Kurseong-Himalayan region. For the ensemble models the RF, KLR, MLP and MARS were used as base classifiers, and Bagging was used as meta classifier. Another objective of the current work is to introduce and evaluate the effectiveness of the novel KLR-Bagging and MARS-Bagging ensembles in susceptibility to landslide. Compiling 303 landslide locations to calibrate and test the models, an inventory map was created. Eighteen LCFs were chosen using the Relief-F and multi-collinearity tests for mapping the landslide susceptibility. Applying receiver operating characteristic (ROC), precision, accuracy, incorrectly categorized proportion, mean-absolute-error (MAE), and root-mean-square-error (RMSE), the LSMs were subsequently verified. The different validation results showed RF-Bagging (AUC training 88.69% & testing 92.28%) with ensemble Meta classifier gives better performance than the MLP, KLR, RF, MARS, MLP-Bagging, KLR-Bagging, and MARS-Bagging based LSMs. RF model showed that the slope, altitude, rainfall, and geomorphology played the most vital role in landslide occurrence comparing the other LCFs.

Assessing the effectiveness of alternative landslide partitioning in machine learning methods for landslide prediction in the complex Himalayan terrain,"Muhammad Tayyib Riaz, Muhammad Basharat, Maria Teresa Brunetti",2022,https://doi.org/10.1177/03091333221113660,https://openalex.org/W4285037646,"Several devastating landslides have occurred in the NW Himalayas, which has prompted several researchers to strive for improvement in landslide susceptibility modelling (LSM) methodologies. This research analyzes the effectiveness of alternative landslide partitioning techniques on LSM in the landslide-prone district, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan. We developed a landslide inventory of 961 landslides and then traditionally divided it into training (672; 70%) and testing (289; 30%) samples. These training samples (672) are processed by the Average Nearest Neighbour Index (ANNI) method to estimate the spatial pattern of landslides in nature. The results provide an ANNI ratio of 0.672 confirming that the landslides distribution pattern is cluster in the complex Himalayan terrain of Muzaffarabad. Among 672, the majority of landslides (529; 79%) depict cluster behaviour, while 189 landslides (21%) depict random behaviour. To evaluate the effectiveness of landslide cluster samples in prediction, five machine learning algorithms (MLAs), that is, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Logistic Regression (LR) using proposed cluster (529) and traditional (672) random training samples along with 17 geo-environmental factors are executed. However, testing samples (289; 30%) separated at the initial stage remained the same to check the model’s effectiveness. The areas under the curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, specificity, Kappa index and accuracy (ACC) have been used to evaluate the MLA’s performances. An alternative partitioning technique (cluster) shows the highest predictive power with AUC-ROC values ranging from 0.96 to 0.86, Kappa index ranges from 0.76 to 0.60 and ACC ranges from 0.90 to 0.83. Conversely, the random partitioning approach performs less well with AUC-ROC values ranging from 0.95 to 0.83, Kappa index ranges from 0.70 to 0.49 and ACC ranges from 0.87 to 0.80. In comparison, the RF cluster sampling-based model outperforms the other models and their counterparts. The RF model achieved the highest accuracy (0.902), highest AUC (0.962) and highest Kappa index (0.755) followed by XGboost having ACC (0.885), AUC (0.95) and Kappa index (0.724) employing proposed cluster training samples. However, traditional random training samples yield comparatively low ACC of RF (0.868) and XGboost (0.862). These results confirm that cluster training sampling performs well in obtaining reliable and precise LSMs for complex Himalayan terrain. Although random landslide partitioning for training datasets is seldom utilized in LSM, this study highlights that cluster partitioning for landslide training datasets might be a realistic and reliable approach."

Understanding the basis of landslide deformation is essential to prevent damage to properties and losses of life. To forecast the landslides displacement, a hybrid machine learning model is proposed, in which the Variational Modal Decomposition (VMD) is implemented to decompose the measured total surface displacement into the trend and periodic components. The Double Exponential Smoothing algorithm (DES) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) were adopted to predict the trend and the periodic displacement, respectively. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was selected to obtain the optimal ELM model. The proposed method and implementation procedures were illustrated by a step-like landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. For comparison, Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Convolutional Neutral Network–Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN–GRU) were also conducted with the same dataset to forecast the periodic component. The application results show that DES-PSO-ELM outperformed the other two methods in landslide displacement prediction, with RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2 values of 1.295mm, 0.998 mm, 0.008%, and 0.999, respectively."

Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring of active waveguides (i.e. a steel tube with granular internal/external backfill installed through a slope) is becoming an accepted monitoring technology for soil slope stability applications; however, challenges still exist to develop widely applicable AE interpretation strategies. The objective of this study was to develop and demonstrate the use of machine learning (ML) approaches to automatically classify landslide kinematics using AE measurements, based on the standard landslide velocity scale. Datasets from large-scale slope failure simulation experiments were used to train and test the ML models. In addition, an example field application using data from a reactivated landslide at Hollin Hill, North Yorkshire, UK, is presented. The results show that ML can automatically classify landslide kinematics using AE measurements with the accuracy of more than 90%. The combination of two AE features, AE rate and AE rate gradient, enable both velocity and acceleration classifications. A conceptual framework is presented for how this automatic approach would be used for landslide early warning in the field, with considerations given to potentially limited site-specific training data."

Machine learning (ML) techniques have been proposed to study causal factors across many application areas. However, the development of ensemble ML techniques for identifying the geotechnical causal factors for slope failures and their subsequent prediction has lacked in literature. The primary goal of this research is to develop and evaluate novel feature selection methods for identifying causal factors for slope failures and assess the potential of ensemble and individual ML techniques for slope failure prediction. Twenty-one geotechnical causal factors were obtained from 60 sites (both landslide and non-landslide) spread across a landslide-prone area in Mandi, India. Relevant causal factors were evaluated by developing a novel ensemble feature selection method that involved an average of different individual feature selection methods like correlation, information-gain, gain-ratio, OneR, and F-ratio. Furthermore, different ensemble ML techniques (Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), Bagging, Stacking, and Voting) and individual ML techniques (Bayesian network (BN), decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM)) were calibrated to 70% of the locations and tested on 30% of the sites. The ensemble feature selection method yielded six major contributing parameters to slope failures: relative compaction, porosity, saturated permeability, slope angle, angle of the internal friction, and in-situ moisture content. Furthermore, the ensemble RF and AB techniques performed the best compared to other ensemble and individual ML techniques on test data. The present study discusses the implications of different causal factors for slope failure prediction."
A Combination of Deep Autoencoder and Multi-Scale Residual Network for Landslide Susceptibility Evaluation,"Zhuolu Wang, Shenghua Xu, Jiping Liu, Yong Wang, Xinrui Ma, Tao Jiang, Xuan He, Zeya Han",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15030653,https://openalex.org/W4317739604,"Landslide susceptibility evaluation can accurately predict the spatial distribution of potential landslides, which offers great usefulness for disaster prevention, disaster reduction, and land resource management. Aiming at the problems of insufficient samples for landslide compilation, difficulty in expanding landslide samples, and insufficient expression of nonlinear relationships among evaluation factors, this paper proposes a new evaluation method of landslide susceptibility combining deep autoencoder and multi-scale residual network (DAE-MRCNN). In the first step, a deep autoencoder network was used to learn the feature expression of the original landslide data in order to acquire effective features in the data. Next, a multi-scale residual network was constructed; specifically, the model was improved into a deep residual network model by adding skip connections in the convolutional layer. In addition, the multi-scale idea was utilized to fully extract the scale characteristics of the evaluation factors. Finally, the model was used for feature training, and the results were input into the Softmax classifier to complete the prediction of landslide susceptibility. For this purpose, a machine learning method and two state-of-the-art deep learning methods, namely SVM, CPCNN-ML, and 2D-CNN, were utilized to model landslide susceptibility in Hanzhong City, Shaanxi Province. The proposed method produced the highest model performance of 0.891, followed by 0.842, 0.869, and 0.873. The experimental results show that the DAE-MRCNN method can fully express the complex nonlinear relationships among the evaluation factors, alleviate the problem of insufficient samples in convolutional neural networks (CNN) training, and significantly improve the accuracy of susceptibility prediction."
Multimodal multiscale characterization of cascading hazard on mountain terrain,"Rocky Talchabhadel, Shreedhar Maskey, Manish Raj Gouli, Kshitij Dahal, Amrit Thapa, Sanjib Sharma, Amod Mani Dixit, Saurav Kumar",2023,https://doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2022.2162443,https://openalex.org/W4323545562,"Extreme precipitation (rain or/and snow) in upstream areas of the Himalayan region often triggers water and sediment hazards, including flash floods, landslides, debris flow, and river damming. These hazards often interact with the environmental and human systems, resulting in acute and chronic disasters that deleteriously impact the economy, infrastructure, and livelihoods. As cascading and compound hazards become more common in the Himalayan region, a more holistic approach is needed to understand the complex interaction among human, natural, and engineered systems and tackle problems connected to several system constraints. Recent catastrophes like the 2021 Melamchi disaster cannot be attributed to a single cause; rather, they result from several geomorphologic and hydroclimatic factors and physical processes. Individual and interacting dynamics and their cascading and compounding effects occurred in various settings, from high elevations to river valleys along the Melamchi River. This study diagnoses the likely causal effects of hydroclimatic processes of the 2021 Melamchi disaster by integrating space-borne remotely sensed data, hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling, and machine learning techniques. We have evaluated several scenarios of landslide damming and breaching and analyzed flooding impacts on major settlements across the Melamchi River. Model outputs evaluated using satellite flood imagery, field-based surveys, and published reports were used to understand the characteristics of the 2021 Melamchi disaster. We find that earlier rain episodes had saturated the soil and increased the river's water level. Therefore, after the outburst of the landslide dam coupled with heavy downpours, a sudden release of huge water had enormous energy to inundate vast areas of flood plains and damaged settlements near riverbanks far downstream up to the Melamchi Bazar. It was not just one extreme event that led to the devastation but a series of non-extreme events. This further reinforces the idea that not just extreme events, but several not-extreme series of events may lead to disaster. Thus, the chances of such a sequence of cascading events must be investigated for risk computation along with extreme events."

The publications analyzed in this research were extracted from a website comprising landslide research of Bangladesh and by manual search. The aspects of the literature considered are year of publication, the journal where published, location/size of the study area, landslide inventory data type, susceptibility assessment/mapping method, thematic variables used, DEM characteristics, accuracy assessment methods and acquired accuracy of the models. The Chi-square test was conducted and correlation was measured to assess relation between selected features and map accuracy but no significant relationship was found. The studies are concentrated into three administrative districts of Chattogram, Rangamati and Cox's Bazar mainly covering the city centre. The publication rate is increasing but not following the global trend. Though various types of models are used and compared, the application of machine and deep learning algorithms are very limited and no evidence of Physically-based methods is found. Most of the cases, landslide inventory is prepared by conducting field survey, but the size is small.

However, existing approaches generally fail to capture complex spatial deformations and their inter-dependencies in different areas. This work presents a novel landslide prediction model based on graph neural networks, which utilizes graph convolutions to aggregate spatial correlations among different monitored locations. Besides, we introduce a novel locally historical transformer network to capture dynamic spatio-temporal relations and predict the surface deformation. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world data and demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of prediction accuracy and model interpretations."
Classification of Terrestrial Laser Scanner Point Clouds: A Comparison of Methods for Landslide Monitoring from Mathematical Surface Approximation,"Gaël Kermarrec, Zhonglong Yang, Daniel Schröder",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14205099,https://openalex.org/W4304775569,"Terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) are contact-free measuring sensors that record dense point clouds of objects or scenes by acquiring coordinates and an intensity value for each point. The point clouds are scattered and noisy. Performing a mathematical surface approximation instead of working directly on the point cloud is an efficient way to reduce the data storage and structure the point clouds by transforming “data” to “information”. Applications include rigorous statistical testing for deformation analysis within the context of landslide monitoring. In order to reach an optimal approximation, classification and segmentation algorithms can identify and remove inhomogeneous structures, such as trees or bushes, to obtain a smooth and accurate mathematical surface of the ground. In this contribution, we compare methods to perform the classification of TLS point clouds with the aim of guiding the reader through the existing algorithms. Besides the traditional point cloud filtering methods, we will analyze machine learning classification algorithms based on the manual extraction of point cloud features, and a deep learning approach with automatic extraction of features called PointNet++. We have intentionally chosen strategies easy to implement and understand so that our results are reproducible for similar point clouds. We show that each method has advantages and drawbacks, depending on user criteria, such as the computational time, the classification accuracy needed, whether manual extraction is performed or not, and if prior information is required. We highlight that filtering methods are advantageous for the application at hand and perform a mathematical surface approximation as an illustration. Accordingly, we have chosen locally refined B-splines, which were shown to provide an optimal and computationally manageable approximation of TLS point clouds."
Landsifier v1.0: a Python library to estimate likely triggers of mapped landslides,"Kamal Rana, Nishant Malik, Uğur Öztürk",2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3751-2022,https://openalex.org/W4309710810,"Abstract. Landslide hazard models aim at mitigating landslide impact by providing probabilistic forecasting, and the accuracy of these models hinges on landslide databases for model training and testing. Landslide databases at times lack information on the underlying triggering mechanism, making these inventories almost unusable in hazard models. We developed a Python-based unique library, Landsifier, that contains three different machine-Learning frameworks for assessing the likely triggering mechanisms of individual landslides or entire inventories based on landslide geometry. Two of these methods only use the 2D landslide planforms, and the third utilizes the 3D shape of landslides relying on an underlying digital elevation model (DEM). The base method extracts geometric properties of landslide polygons as a feature space for the shallow learner – random forest (RF). An alternative method relies on landslide planform images as an input for the deep learning algorithm – convolutional neural network (CNN). The last framework extracts topological properties of 3D landslides through topological data analysis (TDA) and then feeds these properties as a feature space to the random forest classifier. We tested all three interchangeable methods on several inventories with known triggers spread over the Japanese archipelago. To demonstrate the effectiveness of developed methods, we used two testing configurations. The first configuration merges all the available data for the k-fold cross-validation, whereas the second configuration excludes one inventory during the training phase to use as the sole testing inventory. Our geometric-feature-based method performs satisfactorily, with classification accuracies varying between 67 % and 92 %. We have introduced a more straightforward but data-intensive CNN alternative, as it inputs only landslide images without manual feature selection. CNN eases the scripting process without losing classification accuracy. Using topological features from 3D landslides (extracted through TDA) in the RF classifier improves classification accuracy by 12 % on average. TDA also requires less training data. However, the landscape autocorrelation could easily bias TDA-based classification. Finally, we implemented the three methods on an inventory without any triggering information to showcase a real-world application."

However, there is often confusion as to which structure, layer number, and sample size are better for a project. To fill this gap, this study conducted a comparative test on typical models for landside detection in the Wenchuan earthquake area, where about 200,000 secondary landslides were available. Multiple structures and layer numbers, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet120, DenseNet201, UNet−, UNet+, and ResUNet were investigated with different sample numbers (100, 1000, and 10,000). Results indicate that VGG models have the highest precision (about 0.9) but the lowest recall (below 0.76); ResNet models display the lowest precision (below 0.86) and a high recall (about 0.85); DenseNet models obtain moderate precision (below 0.88) and recall (about 0.8); while UNet+ also achieves moderate precision (0.8) and recall (0.84). Generally, a larger sample set can lead to better performance for VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet, and deeper layers could improve the detection results for ResNet and DenseNet. This study provides valuable clues for designing models’ type, layers, and sample set, based on tests with a large number of samples."

Alternatively, advanced remote sensing technologies allow rapid and easy data acquisitions and help to improve the traditional method of landslide detection capabilities. For example, machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), challenge conventional techniques by predicting disasters with reasonable accuracy. In this research work, we have utilized open-source datasets (Landsat 8 images and JAXA ALOS DSM) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to identify landslide regions in Rudraprayag using machine learning techniques. Labeled landslide locations are obtained from landslide inventory (by Geological Survey of India). The landslide identification has been performed using SVM, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Minimum Distance, Random forest (RF), and Naïve Bayes techniques, in which SVM and RF outperformed all other techniques by achieving an 87.5% true positive rate (TPR)."
A Postearthquake Multiple Scene Recognition Model Based on Classical SSD Method and Transfer Learning,"Zhiqiang Xu, Yumin Chen, Fan Yang, Tianyou Chu, Hongyan Zhou",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9040238,https://openalex.org/W3015344787,"The recognition of postearthquake scenes plays an important role in postearthquake rescue and reconstruction. To overcome the over-reliance on expert visual interpretation and the poor recognition performance of traditional machine learning in postearthquake scene recognition, this paper proposes a postearthquake multiple scene recognition (PEMSR) model based on the classical deep learning Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) method. In this paper, a labeled postearthquake scenes dataset is constructed by segmenting acquired remote sensing images, which are classified into six categories: landslide, houses, ruins, trees, clogged and ponding. Due to the insufficiency and imbalance of the original dataset, transfer learning and a data augmentation and balancing strategy are utilized in the PEMSR model. To evaluate the PEMSR model, the evaluation metrics of precision, recall and F1 score are used in the experiment. Multiple experimental test results demonstrate that the PEMSR model shows a stronger performance in postearthquake scene recognition. The PEMSR model improves the detection accuracy of each scene compared with SSD by transfer learning and data augmentation strategy. In addition, the average detection time of the PEMSR model only needs 0.4565s, which is far less than the 8.3472s of the traditional Histogram of Oriented Gradient + Support Vector Machine (HOG+SVM) method."

For this, two hybrid models, namely, AdaBoost-based Voting Feature Intervals (ABVFIs) and MultiBoost-based Voting Feature Intervals (MBVFIs) were developed and validated using landslide data collected from one of the landslide affected districts of Vietnam, namely, Muong Lay. Quantitative validation methods including area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate model performance. The results indicated that both the newly developed ensemble models ABVFI (AUC = 0.859) and MBVFI (AUC = 0.839) outperformed the single VFI (AUC = 0.824) model. Thus, ensemble framework-based VFI algorithms can be used for the accurate spatial prediction of landslides, which can also be applied in other landslide prone regions of the world. Landslide susceptibility maps developed by ensemble VFI models can be used for better landslide prevention and risk management of the area."

The proposed two novel ensemble frameworks, BagBFT and RFBFT, and the base model BFT, were used to model landslide susceptibility in Zhashui County (China), which suffers from landslides. Firstly, we identified 169 landslides through field surveys and image interpretation. Then, a landslide inventory map was built. These 169 historical landslides were randomly classified into two groups: 70% for training data and 30% for validation data. Then, 15 landslide conditioning factors were considered for mapping landslide susceptibility. The three ensemble outputs were estimated with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and statistical tests, as well as a new approach, the improved frequency ratio accuracy. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) for the training data (success rate) of the three algorithms were 0.722 for BFT, 0.869 for BagBFT, and 0.895 for RFBFT. The AUCs for the validating groups (prediction rates) were 0.718, 0.834, and 0.872, respectively. The frequency ratio accuracy of the three models was 0.76163 for the BFT model, 0.92220 for the BagBFT model, and 0.92224 for the RFBFT model. Both BagBFT and RFBFT ensembles can improve the accuracy of the BFT base model, and RFBFT was relatively better. Therefore, the RFBFT model is the most effective approach for the accurate modeling of landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). All three models can improve the identification of landslide-prone areas, enhance risk management ability, and afford more detailed information for land-use planning and policy setting."
Multi-Channel Assessment Policies for Energy-Efficient Data Transmission in Wireless Underground Sensor Networks,"S. Rajasoundaran, Prince Mary Stanislaus, Senthil Ganesh Ramasamy, Dharmesh Dhabliya, Vivek Deshpande, Sountharrajan Sehar, Durga Prasad Bavirisetti",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/en16052285,https://openalex.org/W4322629330,"Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUGSNs) transmit data collected from underground objects such as water substances, oil substances, soil contents, and others. In addition, the underground sensor nodes transmit the data to the surface nodes regarding underground irregularities, earthquake, landslides, military border surveillance, and other issues. The channel difficulties of WUGSNs create uncertain communication barriers. Recent research works have proposed different types of channel assessment techniques and security approaches. Moreover, the existing techniques are inadequate to learn the real-time channel attributes in order to build reactive data transmission models. The proposed system implements Deep Learning-based Multi-Channel Learning and Protection Model (DMCAP) using the optimal set of channel attribute classification techniques. The proposed model uses Multi-Channel Ensemble Model, Ensemble Multi-Layer Perceptron (EMLP) Classifiers, Nonlinear Channel Regression models and Nonlinear Entropy Analysis Model, and Ensemble Nonlinear Support Vector Machine (ENLSVM) for evaluating the channel conditions. Additionally, Variable Generative Adversarial Network (VGAN) engine makes the intrusion detection routines under distributed environment. According to the proposed principles, WUGSN channels are classified based on the characteristics such as underground acoustic channels, underground to surface channels and surface to ground station channels. On the classified channel behaviors, EMLP and ENLSVM are operated to extract the Signal to Noise Interference Ratio (SNIR) and channel entropy distortions of multiple channels. Furthermore, the nonlinear regression model was trained for understanding and predicting the link (channel behaviors). The proposed DMCAP has extreme difficulty finding the differences of impacts due to channel issues and malicious attacks. In this regard, the VGAN-Intrusion Detection System (VGAN-IDS) model was configured in the sensor nodes to monitor the channel instabilities against malicious nodes. Thus, the proposed system deeply analyzes multi-channel attribute qualities to improve throughput in uncertain WUGSN. The testbed was created for classified channel parameters (acoustic and air) with uncertain network parameters; the uncertainties of testbed are considered as link failures, noise distortions, interference, node failures, and number of retransmissions. Consequently, the experimental results show that DMCAP attains 10% to 15% of better performance than existing systems through better throughput, minimum retransmission rate, minimum delay, and minimum energy consumption rate. The existing techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)-based Classification (SMC), Optimal Energy-Efficient Transmission (OETN), and channel-aware multi-path routing principles using Reinforcement Learning model (CRLR) are identified as suitable for the proposed experiments."

One of the locations that are prone to landslides in India's Western Ghats of which Goa is a part. This article presents the LSMs prepared for the state of Goa using four standard machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression (LR ), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K -Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). In order to create LSMs, a 78-point landslide inventory, as well as 14 landslide conditioning factors, has been used, including slope, elevation, aspect, total curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, yearly rainfall, Stream Power Index, Topographic Wetness Index, distance to road, depth to bedrock/soil depth, soil type, lithology, and land use land cover. The most pertinent features for the models' construction have been chosen using the Pearson correlation coefficient test and the Random Forest method. The presence of landslides is shown to be strongly influenced by the distance to road, slope of the terrain, and the annual rainfall. The LSMs generated were classified into five levels ranging from very low susceptibility level to very high susceptible. The prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC (AUC-ROC), and True Skill Statistics (TSS) have been used to analyse and compare the LSMs created using various methodologies. All of these algorithms perform pretty well, as evidenced by the overall accuracy scores of 81.90% for LR, 83.33% for SVM, 81.94% for KNN, and 86.11% for RF. SVM and RF are the better approaches for forecasting landslide vulnerability in the research area, according to TSS data. The maximum AUC-ROC of 86% was achieved by the RF algorithm. The results of performance metrics lead to the conclusion that the tree-based RF approach is most appropriate for producing LSM for the state of Goa. The results of this study indicate that more landslide-prone areas can be found in the Sattari, Dharbandora, Sanguem, and Canacona regions of Goa."

However, available information is often incomplete, fragmented and unsuitable for reliable quantitative analysis. Nevertheless, landslide hazard evaluation has a key role in the implementation of risk mitigation policies and an effort should be done to retrieve information and make it useful for this purpose. In this research, we go through this topic of optimising the information available in catalogues, starting from landslide inventory review and constitution of a boosted training dataset, propaedeutic for susceptibility analysis based on machine learning methods. The temporal recurrence of landslide events has been approached here either through the definitions of large-scale quantitative hazard descriptors or by analysis of historical rainfall (i.e., the main triggering factor for the considered shallow earth slope failures) databases through the definition of rainfall probability curves. Spatial and temporal attributes were integrated, selecting potential landslide source areas ranked in terms of hazard. Data integration was also pursued through persistent scatterer interferometry analysis which pointed out areas of interest within potential landslide source areas featured by ongoing ground movement. The consequential approach led to the definition of the first hazard product of the city of Rome at a local scale functional for advisory purposes or the statutory level, representing a thematic layer able to orient the risk managers and infrastructure stakeholders."

First, 89 shallow landslide and debris flow locations were recognized through field surveys and remote sensing interpretation. A total of eight hazard-causing factors, namely, slope, aspect, rock group, land cover, distance to road, distance to river, distance to fault, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were selected to evaluate the spatial relationship with landslide occurrence. As a result of the analysis, the results of the weighting of the hazard-causing factors indicate that the two elements of rock group and distance to river contribute most to the creation of geological hazards. After comparing all the indices of the three models, the random forest model had a higher correct area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.87, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.118, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.045. The SVM model had the highest sensitivity to geological hazards. The results of geological hazard prediction susceptibility analysis matched the actual situation in the study area, and the prediction effects were good. The results of the hazard susceptibility assessment of the three models are able to provide support and help for the prevention and control of geological hazards in the same type of areas."

This paper focuses on Pengyang County, which is situated in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of China, an area prone to landslides. This study investigated the application of machine learning techniques for analyzing landslide susceptibility. To construct and validate the model, we initially compiled a landslide inventory comprising 972 historical landslides and an equivalent number of non-landslide sites (Data sourced from the Pengyang County Department of Natural Resources). To ensure an impartial evaluation, both the landslide and non-landslide datasets were randomly divided into two sets using a 70/30 ratio. Next, we extracted 15 landslide conditioning factors, including the slope angle, elevation, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, TWI (topographic wetness index), TPI (topographic position index), distance to roads and rivers, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), rainfall, land use, lithology, SPI (stream power index), and STI (sediment transport index), from the spatial database. Subsequently, a correlation analysis between the conditioning factors and landslide occurrences was conducted using the certainty factor (CF) method. Three landslide models were established by employing logistic regression (LR), functional trees (FTs), and random subspace functional trees (RSFTs) algorithms. The landslide susceptibility map was categorized into five levels: very low, low, medium, high, and very high susceptibility. Finally, the predictive capability of the three algorithms was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The better the prediction, the higher the AUC value. The results indicate that all three models are predictive and practical, with only minor discrepancies in accuracy. The integrated model (RSFT) displayed the highest predictive performance, achieving an AUC value of 0.844 for the training dataset and 0.837 for the validation dataset. This was followed by the LR model (0.811 for the training dataset and 0.814 for the validation dataset) and the FT model (0.776 for the training dataset and 0.760 for the validation dataset). The proposed methods and resulting landslide susceptibility map can assist researchers and local authorities in making informed decisions for future geohazard prevention and mitigation. Furthermore, they will prove valuable and be useful for other regions with similar geological characteristics features."

Early detection is the key to minimizing the impact of landslides, so it is important to develop accurate and efficient models. An area selected for this study is located in Mawiongrim, Meghalaya, India, which is an active landslide zone. The proposed model uses a bidirectional LSTM to capture the temporal patterns of the input data collected from a long-term real-time monitoring system set up in the area. To evaluate the effectiveness of the predictions, the model is trained using a data set composed of various landslide-related characteristics, such as topography, rainfall, hydrological, and soil properties. The results show that the suggested model is capable of detecting landslides with greater accuracy and the lowest error value relative to other models. Additionally, the model is also able to provide a real-time warning system, making it a viable tool for early landslide detection. The research also highlights the prediction models for matric suction and groundwater level, which are crucial in determining slope stability."

The landslide database, created by satellite imagery and field research, contains an inventory of 3528 cases of slope movements. A database of 12 conditioning factors was prepared, including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, lithology, rainfall, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), distance to streams, distance to faults, distance to roads, and land cover. The database was randomly divided into training and validation sets at a ratio of 70/30. The predictive capabilities of the models were evaluated using overall accuracy (Acc), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), kappa index, and F score measures. The results indicated that RF was the most suitable model for this study area, demonstrating the highest predictive capability (AUC= 0.86) compared to the other models. This aligns with previous landslide studies, which found that ensemble methods like RF and XGBoost offer superior accuracy. The most important causal factors of landslides in the study area were identified as slope, rainfall, and elevation, while the influence rate of TWI and SPI was the minimum. By analyzing a larger inventory of landslides on a more extensive scale, this study aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of landslide predictions in a west Mediterranean morphoclimatic context that encompasses a wide variety of lithologies.

Volcanotectonics focuses on such processes, combining techniques, data, and ideas from structural geology, tectonics, volcano deformation, physical volcanology, seismology, petrology, rock and fracture mechanics and classical physics. A central aim of volcanotectonics is to provide sufficient understanding of the internal processes in volcanoes so that, when combined with monitoring data, reliable forecasting of eruptions, vertical (caldera) and lateral (landslide) collapses and related events becomes possible. To gain such an understanding requires knowledge of the material properties of the magma and the crustal rocks, as well as the associated stress fields, and their evolution. The local stress field depends on the properties of the layers that constitute the volcano and, in particular, the geometric development of its shallow magma chamber. During this decade an increasing use of data from InSAR, pixel offset and structure-from-motion, as well as dense, portable seismic networks will provide further details on the mechanisms of volcanic unrest, magma-chamber rupture, the propagation of magma-filled fractures (dikes, inclined sheets and sills) and lateral and vertical collapse. Additionally, more use will be made of accurate quantitative data from fossil and active volcanoes, combined with realistic numerical, analytical and machine-learning studies, so as to provide reliable models on volcano behaviour and eruption forecasting."

The landslides are typically associated with ground movements that would induce additional stress on the pipeline. Such stress state of pipelines under landslide interference seriously damage structural integrity of the pipeline. Up to the date, limited research has been done on the combined landslide hazard and pipeline stress state analysis. In this paper, a multi-parameter integrated monitoring system was developed for the pipeline stress-strain state and landslide deformation monitoring. Also, data-driven models for the pipeline additional stress prediction was established. The developed predictive models include individual and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. The implementation procedure of the predictive models integrates the field data measured by the monitoring system, with k-fold cross validation used for the generalization performance evaluation. The obtained results indicate that the XGBoost model has the highest performance in the prediction of the additional stress. Besides, the significance of the input variables is determined through sensitivity analyses by using feature importance criteria. Thus, the integrated monitoring system together with the XGBoost prediction method is beneficial to modeling the additional stress in oil and gas pipelines, which will further contribute to pipeline geohazards monitoring management."

Natural hazards such as landslides, whether they are driven by meteorologic or seismic processes, are constantly shaping Earth’s surface. In large percentage of the slope failures, they are also causing huge human and economic losses. As the problem is complex in its nature, proper mitigation and prevention strategies are not straightforward to implement. One important step in the correct direction is the integration of different fields; as such, in this work, we are providing a general overview of approaches and techniques which are adopted and integrated for landslide monitoring and mapping, as both activities are important in the risk prevention strategies. Detailed landslide inventory is important for providing the correct information of the phenomena suitable for further modelling, analysing and implementing suitable mitigation measures. On the other hand, timely monitoring of active landslides could provide priceless insights which can be sufficient for reducing damages. Therefore, in this work popular methods are discussed that use remotely-sensed datasets with a particular focus on the implementation of machine learning into landslide detection, susceptibility modelling and its implementation in early-warning systems. Moreover, it is reviewed how Citizen Science is adopted by scholars for providing valuable landslide-specific information, as well as couple of well-known platforms for Volunteered Geographic Information which have the potential to contribute and be used also in the landslide studies. In addition to proving an overview of the most popular techniques, this paper aims to highlight the importance of implementing interdisciplinary approaches."
"Comparison of landslide susceptibility models and their robustness analysis: a case study from the NW Himalayas, Pakistan","Nawaz Ikram, Muhammad Basharat, Asghar Ali, Nadeem Ahmad Usmani, Syed Ahsan Hussain Gardezi, Mian Luqman Hussain, Muhammad Tayyib Riaz",2021,https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.2017010,https://openalex.org/W4200297035,"Machine learning methods are considered as most effective approaches to accomplish landslide susceptibility analysis around the globe. Landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) have been frequently executed by statistical models in NW Himalaya. However, the comparison and applications of the statistical models with modern machine learning techniques has not been fully explored in this region. Hence, this study aims to compare the predicted performance of statistical and popular machine learning models to explore robust landslide prediction model in the landslide-prone area of NW Himalaya and investigate the compensations and limitations of these models to grasp a more precise and consistent result. This study presented machine learning approaches based on the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) and the statistical methods based on the frequency ratio (FR), information value (InfoV) and weight of evidence (WoE). For this purpose, first an inventory map of 1507 landslides was prepared and randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset. Furthermore, 12 landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were extracted from geospatial dataset to prepare thematic layers in ArcGIS. Thereafter, factor analysis was performed to eliminate colinear and least important variables which can mislead the results. The results showed that all selected LCFs are noncolinear and have significant contribution on landslides initiation, however, lithology, slope angle, annual rainfall and landuse were most influential factors. For modeling purpose, landslide inventory was correlated against all LCFs and trained into six models to produce respective LSMs. Finally, the performance of produced LSM models was validated and compared through area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Accuracy, Recall, F1-score and Cohen's Kappa coefficients to assess the robustness of employed models. The results exhibit that the performance scores of machine learning models were considerably superior than statistical models. While, the AUROC values based on validation dataset indicate that LR (0.89) has better prediction ability followed by SVM (0.86), ANN (0.84), FR (0.83), InfoV (0.82) and WoE (0.81) in this study. Therefore, it is reasoned out that the machine learning methods are more reliable in generating adequate LSMs. However, the LR is recommended as most efficient model for predicting landslide susceptible zones in study region and thus can be considered as robust model for landslide susceptibility assessment in similar geo-environmental regimes."
DATA IMBALANCE IN LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY ZONATION: UNDER-SAMPLING FOR CLASS-IMBALANCE LEARNING,"Sharad Kumar Gupta, Muskan Jhunjhunwalla, Amit Bhardwaj, Dericks Praise Shukla",2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w11-51-2020,https://openalex.org/W3006156652,"Abstract. Machine learning methods such as artificial neural network, support vector machine etc. require a large amount of training data, however, the number of landslide occurrences are limited in a study area. The limited number of landslides leads to a small number of positive class pixels in the training data. On contrary, the number of non-landslide pixels (negative class pixels) are enormous in numbers. This under-represented data and severe class distribution skew create a data imbalance for learning algorithms and suboptimal models, which are biased towards the majority class (non-landslide pixels) and have low performance on the minority class (landslide pixels).In this work, we have used two algorithms namely EasyEnsemble and BalanceCascade for balancing the data. This balanced data is used with feature selection methods such as fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) to generate LSZ maps The results of the study show that ANN with balanced data has major improvements in preparation of susceptibility maps over imbalanced data, where as the LR method is ill-effected by data balancing algorithms. The FDA does not show significant changes between balanced and imbalanced data."

Landslide susceptibility evaluation (LSE) can predict where landslides may occur and has caught the attention of scientists all over the world. This work establishes integrated criteria of potential landslide recognition and combines the historical landslides and newly-identified potential landslides to improve the accuracy, rationality, and practicability of a LSE map. Moreover, slope units can well reflect the topographic constraint to landslide occurrence and development, and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can well portray the topological and feature relation among various slope units. The combination of slope units and GCN is for the first time employed in LSE. This work focuses on Wanzhou District, a famous landslide-serious region in the Three Gorges reservoir area, and employs multisource data to conduct potential landslide recognition and LSE and to reveal the distribution characteristics of high landslide susceptibility. Some new viewpoints are suggested as follows. 1) The established criteria of potential landslide recognition consist of the characteristics of active deformation, stratum and lithology, tectonics, topography, micro-geomorphology, environment, meteorology, earthquakes, and human engineering activity. These criteria can well eliminate 4 types of false alarm regions and is successfully validated by field survey. 2) 34 potential landslides are newly discovered, and the movement of these potential landslides were controlled or induced by the combined action of soft-hard interbedding rock mass, steep topography, frequent tectonic movement, strong fluvial erosion, abundant precipitation, and intensive road and building construction. 3) The GCN algorithm reaches a relatively high accuracy (AUC: 0.941) and outperforms the other representative machine learning algorithms of Convolutional Neural Network (AUC: 0.926), Support Vector Machine (AUC: 0.835), and CART Tree (AUC: 0.762). 4) High landslide susceptibility is caused by the coupled action of weathered rock cavities, soft rock and swelling soil, strong river erosion, abundant rainfall, and intensive human engineering activity."
Machine Learning Approaches for Slope Deformation Prediction Based on Monitored Time-Series Displacement Data: A Comparative Investigation,"Ning Xi, Qiang Yang, Yingjie Sun, Gang Mei",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/app13084677,https://openalex.org/W4363678285,"Slope deformation prediction is one of the critical factors in the early warning of slope failure. Establishing an accurate slope deformation prediction model is important. Time-series displacement data of slopes directly reflect the deformation characteristics and stability properties of slopes. The use of existing data analysis approaches, such as statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, to establish a reasonable and accurate prediction model based on the monitored time-series displacement data is a common solution to slope deformation prediction. In this paper, we conduct a comparative investigation of machine learning approaches for slope deformation prediction based on monitored time-series displacement data. First, we established eleven slope deformation prediction models based on the time-series displacement data obtained from seven in situ monitoring points of the Huanglianshu landslide using machine learning approaches. Second, four evaluation metrics were used to comparatively analyze the prediction performance of all models at each monitoring point. The experimental results of the Huanglianshu landslide indicated that the long-short-term memory (LSTM) model with an attention mechanism and the transformer model achieved the highest prediction accuracy. The comparative analysis of model characteristics suggested that the Transformer model is better adapted to predict nonlinear landslide displacements that are affected by multiple factors. The drawn conclusion could help select a suitable slope deformation model for early landslide warnings."

This study assesses landslide susceptibility by employing geographic information systems (GIS) and machine learning techniques, that is, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), with the integration of advanced optimization techniques, that is, particle swarm optimization (PSO). The landslide-inducing factors considered in this study include fault density, lithology, road density, slope, elevation, flow direction, aspect, earthquake intensity, curvature, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), waterways density, rainfall, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The resulting landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) showed that the areas falling under the high and very high susceptibility class have higher rainfall levels, weak lithology, high NDWI, and flow direction. The accuracy assessment of the techniques showed that ANN with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.81 performed better than SVM with an AUC of 0.78 without the optimization. Similarly, the performance of ANN was also better than SVM using PSO. During the integrated modeling, the AUC of PSO-ANN was 0.87, whereas the AUC of PSO–SVM was 0.84. The accuracy assessment of the produced LSMs also showed a similar trend in terms of accuracy percentage as that of the models."
From tree to forest: Multiple carbon sink constraints,"Hui Liu, Lin Zhang, Qin Ma, Wei Zhao, Yiping Chen",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2023.100463,https://openalex.org/W4381325494,"Forests are the largest carbon sinks among terrestrial ecosystems. They sequestrate carbon primarily through tree growth but are currently under severe threat from global change. Recently, Tavares et al.1Tavares J.V. Oliveira R.S. Mencuccini M. et al.Basin-wide variation in tree hydraulic safety margins predicts the carbon balance of Amazon forests.Nature. 2023; 617: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar identified a crucial trait, the xylem hydraulic safety margin (HSM), for predicting the risk of drought-induced tree mortality and biomass in Amazon forests. They also found that old-growth forests with wide HSMs build more biomass, while fast-growing forests are exposed to greater hydraulic risks and have a higher mortality rate. Therefore, they speculated that climate change could lead to further reductions in plant HSMs in the Amazon, resulting in a potential loss of biomass, which, in turn, would have major impacts on the carbon sink. However, a global perspective is urgently needed to evaluate the effects of global change on tree mortality and carbon sinks that encompass different physiological mechanisms and environmental factors across temporal and spatial scales. Therefore, we created a framework to examine forest response and adaptation in the context of future global change and discussed each issue (Figure 1). From an ecophysiological perspective, the trade-off between plant growth and mortality explained the results in the Amazon while suggesting more. Numerous studies have shown the trade-off that fast-growing trees are likely to achieve tall statures as large trees and contribute the dominant biomass in forests but at the cost of higher vulnerability to hydraulic embolism.2Liu H. Gleason S.M. Hao G. et al.Hydraulic traits are coordinated with maximum plant height at the global scale.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5eaav1332Google Scholar However, the high mortality risk for large trees is not only due to hydraulic limitations but also other disturbances, including warming, wind, fire, and human activities such as logging, all of which disproportionately affect large trees and, thus, exacerbate the cascading decline in forest carbon budgets. For Tavares et al.,1Tavares J.V. Oliveira R.S. Mencuccini M. et al.Basin-wide variation in tree hydraulic safety margins predicts the carbon balance of Amazon forests.Nature. 2023; 617: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar drought events are the most important factor affecting Amazon forest dynamics. Therefore, they used six hydraulic traits to predict forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and found that HSMs are associated with stem mortality rate and ΔAGB (AGB changes between approximately 10-year survey intervals). Although drought can act as a precursor to subsequent disturbances, such as fire and insect infestation, in regions where tree growth and mortality are limited by other factors, like sunlight and temperature, more traits are needed to predict biomass changes. For example, traits associated with growth (e.g., photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, leaf area index, carbohydrate content, or longevity) and mortality take precedence over drought (e.g., plant thermal safety margin, mechanical properties, flammability, or biochemical defenses).3Anderegg W.R.L. Trugman A.T. Badgley G. et al.Divergent forest sensitivity to repeated extreme droughts.Nat. Clim. Change. 2020; 10: 1091-1095Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar These traits may reveal broader physiological mechanisms for accurately predicting forest carbon dynamics, especially when multiple climate stresses occur simultaneously in the future. Tree mortality can significantly alter species components and community structures in forests, leading to different biomass responses in different regions, depending on vegetation types and environmental drivers. Tavares et al.1Tavares J.V. Oliveira R.S. Mencuccini M. et al.Basin-wide variation in tree hydraulic safety margins predicts the carbon balance of Amazon forests.Nature. 2023; 617: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar found that species in the southern and western Amazon are more susceptible to drought (lower HSMs and more deciduousness) and experience higher mortality and biomass decline compared with species in the central eastern Amazon, which may trigger xerophilization of these forests. In contrast, the long-term forest inventory in Tibet (1973–2018) has shown that the biomass of deciduous broadleaved forests has increased significantly since 1999, while the biomass of the evergreen coniferous forests has decreased. Unlike the Amazon drought, such a transition of species components in alpine forests is believed to be caused by climate warming, wildfires, and deforestation. Regarding community structure, long-term plot inventories have shown that large old trees have gradually disappeared worldwide over the past century. For example, in situ surveys combined with dendroecological data have shown that the density of small trees in Tibetan forests has increased rapidly since the 1950s, when dramatic warming and rising of CO2 began. Such phenomena also occurred in the US, Australia, Sweden, and Brazil, leading to significant biomass declines. At the ecosystem level, the study of vegetation thresholds and their environmental drivers is critical for predicting carbon sinks. Tavares et al.1Tavares J.V. Oliveira R.S. Mencuccini M. et al.Basin-wide variation in tree hydraulic safety margins predicts the carbon balance of Amazon forests.Nature. 2023; 617: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar demonstrated the importance of HSMs in predicting long-term carbon sequestration, bridging the knowledge gap between carbon sinks and climate change through plant physiological mechanisms. However, the plant HSM is a flexible trait that can vary temporally and spatially even within the same species. Therefore, frequent measurements of HSMs are required to determine the water threshold in real time. In addition, it is more difficult to estimate environmental thresholds for ecosystems4Berdugo M. Delgado-Baquerizo M. Soliveres S. et al.Global ecosystem thresholds driven by aridity.Science. 2020; 367: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar because the trade-off between growth and mortality is closely related to the balance between ecosystem resilience and resistance to disturbance. Thus, a stress that exceeds the threshold for individual trees may not necessarily reach the threshold for the entire ecosystem, and even when the stress exceeds the threshold for the ecosystem, the forest can re-establish a new equilibrium, whereupon the ecosystem functions may be promoted through shifts in species components or resource partitioning. Generally, a forest and its biomass are stable as long as external disturbances do not exceed its ecosystem threshold. However, because ecosystem thresholds vary across biomes and by time periods, precise and timely quantification of the thresholds is critical for biomass monitoring. From a technical perspective, Tavares et al.1Tavares J.V. Oliveira R.S. Mencuccini M. et al.Basin-wide variation in tree hydraulic safety margins predicts the carbon balance of Amazon forests.Nature. 2023; 617: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar used a traditional method to estimate biomass from tree diameter at breast height (DBH), height, wood density, and demographic data, while multi-source remote sensing can determine biomass at larger scales in more precise and efficient ways. For example, researchers found drought-induced tree mortality rate two times higher in taller trees than smaller ones by tracking mortality over approximately two million trees individually, which was only possible using fine-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. With sample plots as quadrats, LiDAR and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can make inferences about the biomass from tree to forest. LiDAR can provide precise quantification of three-dimensional forest structures, allowing precise positioning and identification of individual trees. GPR transmits high-frequency electromagnetic waves into the ground and receives the reflected waves. Variations in waveform, amplitude, and time characterize the location, morphology, and burial depth of subsurface media, making it easy to calculate belowground biomass, which is very important for forest ecology. Using tree structural parameters of each components (leaves, branches, trunks, and roots), the total biomass of individual trees can be accurately determined by allometric growth equations. In addition, large-scale machine learning-based models can improve the efficiency and precision of individual tree segmentation and tree structural estimations, such as measurements of DBH, height, and crown size of trees. To scale regional monitoring data to a global forecast, the combination of multi-temporal, broad-scale remote sensing imagery, such as Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with fine-resolution LiDAR (aboveground) and GPR (belowground) datasets can achieve near-global coverage of land surface changes and carbon dynamics over decades. Additionally, large-scale remote sensing validated by field observations can provide insights into how vegetation has been disturbed by and recovered from natural disasters, which, in turn, can support process-based modeling and prediction of future carbon sinks. With the rapid accumulation and development of remote sensing data, new algorithms, and process-based modeling, forest biomass estimation and prediction can be greatly improved at multiple temporal-spatial scales. Forest biomass dynamics are influenced not only by the trade-off between growth and mortality in climatically normal years1Tavares J.V. Oliveira R.S. Mencuccini M. et al.Basin-wide variation in tree hydraulic safety margins predicts the carbon balance of Amazon forests.Nature. 2023; 617: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar but also by natural extreme disturbances. The latter factor is even more important because of the increasing frequency and severity of extreme events, such as heatwaves, droughts, high winds, floods, freezes, and cascading disasters, such as wildfires, insect attacks, and landslides. There is growing evidence of large-scale tree mortality because of disturbances that have led to abrupt declines in biomass in many biomes worldwide.3Anderegg W.R.L. Trugman A.T. Badgley G. et al.Divergent forest sensitivity to repeated extreme droughts.Nat. Clim. Change. 2020; 10: 1091-1095Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar Examples include trees burned in devastating wildfires in the western US, Australia, and boreal forests; tree mortality caused by extreme droughts in Mediterranean climates; and insect attacks on vulnerable trees suffering from droughts. A mechanistic understanding of how forests are disturbed by and recover from these disasters can improve forest ecosystem modeling and prediction of forest carbon sinks in the context of global change in the future. Human activities are also changing forest biomass dynamics through deforestation, reforestation, and protection of natural forests.5McDowell N.G. Allen C.D. Anderson-Teixeira K. et al.Pervasive shifts in forest dynamics in a changing world.Science. 2020; 368eaaz9463Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar These activities have contributed to global greening through plantations in Asia but have also caused enormous carbon emissions in the Amazon through deforestation and farming. Thus, to better understand forest carbon dynamics, comprehensive assessments of natural disturbances and human activities are essential to complement natural forest growth. Overall, we hope that this framework of multiple constraints on forest carbon sinks can provide a roadmap for plant physiologists, ecologists, hydrologists, geographers, and climatologists to study forest responses and adaptations to future global change and to promote interdisciplinary collaboration.

Landslide Recognition from Multi-Feature Remote Sensing Data Based on Improved Transformers,"Renxiang Huang, Tao Chen",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15133340,https://openalex.org/W4382599459,"Efficient and accurate landslide recognition is crucial for disaster prevention and post-disaster rescue efforts. However, compared to machine learning, deep learning approaches currently face challenges such as long model runtimes and inefficiency. To tackle these challenges, we proposed a novel knowledge distillation network based on Swin-Transformer (Distilled Swin-Transformer, DST) for landslide recognition. We created a new landslide sample database and combined nine landslide influencing factors (LIFs) with remote sensing images (RSIs) to evaluate the performance of DST. Our approach was tested in Zigui County, Hubei Province, China, and our quantitative evaluation showed that the combined RSIs with LIFs improved the performance of the landslide recognition model. Specifically, our model achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA), Precision, Recall, F1-Score (F1), and Kappa that were 0.8381%, 0.6988%, 0.9334%, 0.8301%, and 0.0125 higher, respectively, than when using only RSIs. Compared with the results of other neural networks, namely ResNet50, Swin-Transformer, and DeiT, our proposed deep learning model achieves the best OA (98.1717%), Precision (98.1672%), Recall (98.1667%), F1 (98.1615%), and Kappa (0.9766). DST has the lowest number of FLOPs, which is crucial for improving computational efficiency, especially in landslide recognition applications after geological disasters. Our model requires only 2.83 GFLOPs, which is the lowest among the four models and is 1.8242 GFLOPs, 1.741 GFLOPs, and 2.0284 GFLOPs less than ResNet, Swin, and DeiT, respectively. The proposed method has good applicability in rapid recognition scenarios after geological disasters."

To validate the model performance, a landslide inventory containing 1147 historical landslide polygons and the data of 12 landslide factors in the Wenchuan area in southwestern China, was presented and separated into training and validating dataset using a 7:3 randomly sampling ratio strategy. Based on AUC and Accuracy, GL-ResNet (0.96 and 0.909) outperformed logistic regression (0.92 and 0.851), support vector machines (0.94 and 0.884), deep belief networks (0.95 and 0.884), gated recurrent unit (0.94 and 0.884) and ResNet (0.95 and 0.894). We also explored the robustness of GL-ResNet for LSM. The results suggested that although GL-ResNet is sensitive to initial training conditions, it showed good robustness to model training method and sample ratios. In detail, GL-ResNet outperformed the conventional models in terms of fitting power and prediction performance by 0.03-0.04 and 0.02 respectively in most cases, with even greater differences in the limited training dataset."

Investigation of landslide dam life span using prediction models based on multiple machine learning algorithms,"Hao Wu, Tingkai Nian, Zhigang Shan",2023,https://doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2023.2273213,https://openalex.org/W4387958759,"A rapid and accurate prediction of a landslide dam's life span is of significant importance for emergency geological treatment. However, current prediction models for the state of a landslide dam are based solely on geomorphological indexes, and do not take into consideration attribute properties such as landslide types, trigger factors, and dam types. This study investigates the relationships between a landslide dam's geometry and the capacity of the barrier lake and proposes fitting models, which supplement the current landslide dam database. Subsequently, six predictive models for landslide dam life span are established, utilizing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, Naïve Bayes, decision tree, and random forest, which consider five factors, including geometry parameters and attribute properties. The performances of these six models are analyzed and compared to a typical prediction model, the dimensionless blockage index (DBI). The results suggest that the models established in this study not only have a consistent absolute accuracy as the DBI model, but also overcome the disadvantage that a large number of cases cannot be judged by the DBI model. Among the formulated machine learning models, the random forest model exhibits the highest absolute accuracy (89%), lowest error rate (7%), lowest false alarm rate (15%), and no uncertainty rate. Additionally, three renowned landslide dams, namely the Costantino, Hsiaolin, and Baige landslide dams, are analyzed to illustrate the applicability of the established machine learning models. The study results provide essential guidance for the predictions and emergency geological treatments of landslide dam disasters."

However, there remains no consensus on which method is optimal for LSM. This study implements a dynamic approach to landslide hazard mapping by integrating spatio-temporal probability analysis with time-varying ground deformation velocity derived from the MT-InSAR (Multi-Temporal InSAR) method. Reliable landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) can inform landslide risk managers and government officials. First, sixteen factors were selected to construct a causal factor system for LSM. Next, Pearson correlation analysis, multicollinearity analysis, information gain ratio, and GeoDetector methods were applied to remove the least important factors of STI, plan curvature, TRI, and slope length. Subsequently, information quantity (IQ), logistic regression (LR), frequency ratio (FR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods were performed to construct the LSM. The results showed that the distance to a river, slope angle, distance from structure, and engineering geological rock group were the main factors controlling landslide development. A comprehensive set of statistical indicators was employed to evaluate these methods’ effectiveness; sensitivity, F1-measure, and AUC (area under the curve) were calculated and subsequently compared to assess the performance of the methods. Machine learning methods’ training and prediction accuracy were higher than those of statistical methods. The AUC values of the IQ, FR, LR, BP-ANN, RBF-ANN, RF, SVM, and CNN methods were 0.810, 0.854, 0.828, 0.895, 0.916, 0.932, 0.948, and 0.957, respectively. Although the performance order varied for other statistical indicators, overall, the CNN method was the best, while the BP-ANN and RBF-ANN method was the worst among the five examined machine methods. Hence, adopting the CNN approach in this study can enhance LSM accuracy, catering to the needs of planners and government agencies responsible for managing landslide-prone areas and preventing landslide-induced disasters."
Dynamic prediction of landslide life expectancy using ensemble system incorporating classical prediction models and machine learning,"Leilei Liu, Hao-Dong Yin, Ting Xiao, Lei Huang, Yung‐Ming Cheng",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2023.101758,https://openalex.org/W4388905822,"With the development of landslide monitoring system, many attempts have been made to predict landslide failure-time utilizing monitoring data of displacements. Classical models (e.g., Verhulst, GM (1,1), and Saito models) that consider the characteristics of landslide displacement to determine the failure-time have been investigated extensively. In practice, monitoring is continuously implemented with monitoring data-set updated, meaning that the predicted landslide life expectancy (i.e., the lag between the predicted failure-time and time node at each instant of conducting the prediction) should be re-evaluated with time. This manner is termed ""dynamic prediction"". However, the performances of the classical models have not been discussed in the context of the dynamic prediction yet. In this study, such performances are investigated firstly, and disadvantages of the classical models are then reported, incorporating the monitoring data from four real landslides. Subsequently, a more qualified ensemble model is proposed, where the individual classical models are integrated by machine learning (ML)-based meta model. To evaluate the quality of the models under the dynamic prediction, a novel indicator termed 'discredit index (β)' is proposed, and a higher value of β indicates lower prediction quality. It is found that Verhulst and Saito models would produce predicted results with significantly higher β, while GM (1,1) model would indicate results with the highest mean absolute error (MAE). Meanwhile, the ensemble models are found to be more accurate and qualified than the classical models. Here, the performance of decision tree regression (DTR)-based ensemble model is the best among the various ML-based ensemble models."

In this work, a Machine Learning algorithm such as the Random Forest has been used to assess the probability of occurrence of the anomalies induced by slope instability and subsidence. About 20,000 anomalies (about 7000 and 13,000 for the slope instability and the subsidence, respectively) were collected between 2018 and 2020 and were used as input, while ten different variables were selected, five related to the morphological and geological setting of the study area and five to the radar characteristics of the data. The resulting maps may provide useful indications of where a sudden change of displacement trend may occur, analyzing the contribution of each factor. The cross-validation with the anomalies collected in a following timespan (2020–2021) and with official landslide and subsidence inventories provided by the regional authority has confirmed the reliability of the final maps. The adoption of a map for assessing the probability of the occurrence of MTInSAR anomalies may serve as an enhanced geohazard prevention measurement, to be periodically updated and refined in order to have the most precise knowledge possible of the territory."
"Susceptibility Mapping of Typical Geological Hazards in Helong City Affected by Volcanic Activity of Changbai Mountain, Northeastern China","Xiaohui Sun, YU Cheng-long, Yanrong Li, Ngambua N. Rene",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11060344,https://openalex.org/W4281728958,"The purpose of this paper was to produce the geological hazard-susceptibility map for the Changbai Mountain area affected by volcanic activity. First, 159 landslides and 72 debris flows were mapped in the Helong city are based on the geological disaster investigation and regionalization (1:50,000) project of Helong City. Then, twelve landslide conditioning factors and eleven debris flow conditioning factors were selected as the modeling variables. Among them, the transcendental probability of Changbai Mountain volcanic earthquake greater than VI degrees was used to indicate the relationship between the geological hazard-susceptibility and Changbai Mountain volcanic earthquake occurrence. Furthermore, two machine learning models (SVM and ANN) were introduced to geological hazard-susceptibility modeling. Receiver operating characteristic curve, statistical analysis method, and five-fold cross-validation were used to compare the two models. Based on the modeling results, the SVM model is the better model for both the landslide and debris flow susceptibility mapping. The results show that the areas with low, moderate, high, and very high landslide susceptibility are 31.58%, 33.15%, 17.07%, and 18.19%, respectively; and the areas with low, moderate, high, and very high debris flow susceptibility are 25.63%, 38.19%, 23.47%, and 12.71%, respectively. The high and very high landslide and debris flow susceptibility classes make up 85.54% and 80.55% of the known landslides and debris flow, respectively. Moreover, the very high and high landslide and debris flow susceptibility are mainly distributed in the lower elevation area, and mainly distributed around the cities and towns in Helong City. Consequently, this paper will be a useful guide for the deployment of disaster prevention and mitigation in Helong city, and can also provide some reference for evaluation of landslide susceptibility in other volcanically active areas."
Determination of Landslide Displacement Warning Thresholds by Applying DBA-LSTM and Numerical Simulation Algorithms,"Yue Dai, Wujiao Dai, Wenkun Yu, Dongxin Bai",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/app12136690,https://openalex.org/W4283785408,"Numerical simulation has emerged as a powerful technique for landslide failure mechanism analysis and accurate stability assessment. However, due to the bias of simplified numerical models and the uncertainty of geomechanical parameters, simulation results often differ greatly from the actual situation. Therefore, in order to ensure the accuracy and rationality of numerical simulation results, and to improve landslide hazard warning capability, techniques and methods such as displacement back-analysis, machine learning, and numerical simulation are combined to create a novel landslide warning method based on DBA-LSTM (displacement back-analysis based on long short-term memory networks), and a numerical simulation algorithm is proposed, i.e., the DBA-LSTM algorithm is used to invert the equivalent physical and mechanical parameters of the numerical model, and the modified numerical model is used for stability analysis and failure simulation. Taking the Shangtan landslide as an example, the deformation mechanism of the landslide was analyzed based on the field monitoring data, and subsequently, the superiority of the DBA-LSTM algorithm was verified by comparing it with DBA-BPNN (displacement back-analysis based on back-propagation neural network); finally, the stability of the landslide was analyzed and evaluated a posteriori using the warning threshold calculated by the proposed method. The analytical results show that the displacement back-analysis based on the machine learning (DBA-ML) algorithm can achieve more than 95% accuracy, and the deep learning algorithm exemplified by LSTM had higher accuracy compared to the classical BPNN algorithm, meaning that it can be used to further improve the existing intelligent inversion theory and method. The proposed method calculates the landslide’s factor of safety (FOS) before the accelerated deformation to be 1.38 and predicts that the landslide is in a metastable state after accelerated deformation rather than in failure. Compared to traditional empirical warning models, our method can avoid false warnings and can provide a new reference for research on landslide hazard warnings."
Application of Transformer Models to Landslide Susceptibility Mapping,"Shuai Bao, Jiping Liu, Liang Wang, Xizhi Zhao",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22239104,https://openalex.org/W4309916322,"Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is of great significance for the identification and prevention of geological hazards. LSM is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs); CNNs use fixed convolutional kernels, focus more on local information and do not retain spatial information. This is a property of the CNN itself, resulting in low accuracy of LSM. Based on the above problems, we use Vision Transformer (ViT) and its derivative model Swin Transformer (Swin) to conduct LSM for the selected study area. Machine learning and a CNN model are used for comparison. Fourier transform amplitude, feature similarity and other indicators were used to compare and analyze the difference in the results. The results show that the Swin model has the best accuracy, F1-score and AUC. The results of LSM are combined with landslide points, faults and other data analysis; the ViT model results are the most consistent with the actual situation, showing the strongest generalization ability. In this paper, we believe that the advantages of ViT and its derived models in global feature extraction ensure that ViT is more accurate than CNN and machine learning in predicting landslide probability in the study area."
"Mapping Outburst Floods Using a Collaborative Learning Method Based on Temporally Dense Optical and SAR Data: A Case Study with the Baige Landslide Dam on the Jinsha River, Tibet","Zhongkang Yang, Jinbing Wei, Jianhui Deng, Yunjian Gao, Siyuan Zhao, Zhiliang He",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13112205,https://openalex.org/W3170089617,"Outburst floods resulting from giant landslide dams can cause devastating damage to hundreds or thousands of kilometres of a river. Accurate and timely delineation of flood inundated areas is essential for disaster assessment and mitigation. There have been significant advances in flood mapping using remote sensing images in recent years, but little attention has been devoted to outburst flood mapping. The short-duration nature of these events and observation constraints from cloud cover have significantly challenged outburst flood mapping. This study used the outburst flood of the Baige landslide dam on the Jinsha River on 3 November 2018 as an example to propose a new flood mapping method that combines optical images from Sentinel-2, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1 and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). First, in the cloud-free region, a comparison of four spectral indexes calculated from time series of Sentinel-2 images indicated that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the threshold of 0.15 provided the best separation flooded area. Subsequently, in the cloud-covered region, an analysis of dual-polarization RGB false color composites images and backscattering coefficient differences of Sentinel-1 SAR data were found an apparent response to ground roughness’s changes caused by the flood. We carried out the flood range prediction model based on the random forest algorithm. Training samples consisted of 13 feature vectors obtained from the Hue-Saturation-Value color space, backscattering coefficient differences/ratio, DEM data, and a label set from the flood range prepared from Sentinel-2 images. Finally, a field investigation and confusion matrix tested the prediction accuracy of the end-of-flood map. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 92.3%, 0.89 respectively. The full extent of the outburst floods was successfully obtained within five days of its occurrence. The multi-source data merging framework and the massive sample preparation method with SAR images proposed in this paper, provide a practical demonstration for similar machine learning applications using remote sensing."
Integrating InSAR Observables and Multiple Geological Factors for Landslide Susceptibility Assessment,"Yan-Ting Lin, Yi-Keng Chen, Kuo‐Hsin Yang, Chuin‐Shan Chen, Jen-Yu Han",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11167289,https://openalex.org/W3188130065,"Due to extreme weather, researchers are constantly putting their focus on prevention and mitigation for the impact of disasters in order to reduce the loss of life and property. The disaster associated with slope failures is among the most challenging ones due to the multiple driving factors and complicated mechanisms between them. In this study, a modern space remote sensing technology, InSAR, was introduced as a direct observable for the slope dynamics. The InSAR-derived displacement fields and other in situ geological and topographical factors were integrated, and their correlations with the landslide susceptibility were analyzed. Moreover, multiple machine learning approaches were applied with a goal to construct an optimal model between these complicated factors and landslide susceptibility. Two case studies were performed in the mountainous areas of Taiwan Island and the model performance was evaluated by a confusion matrix. The numerical results revealed that among different machine learning approaches, the Random Forest model outperformed others, with an average accuracy higher than 80%. More importantly, the inclusion of the InSAR data resulted in an improved model accuracy in all training approaches, which is the first to be reported in all of the scientific literature. In other words, the proposed approach provides a novel integrated technique that enables a highly reliable analysis of the landslide susceptibility so that subsequent management or reinforcement can be better planned."
Advanced data mining techniques for landslide susceptibility mapping,"Muhammad Bello Ibrahim, Zahiraniza Mustaffa, Abdul‐Lateef Balogun, Indra Sati Hamonangan Harahap, Mudassir Ali Khan",2021,https://doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2021.1960433,https://openalex.org/W3201629504,"This paper describes the development and validation of landslides susceptibility models for mountainous regions using advanced data mining techniques. The investigation was carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of Naïve Bayes Multinomial (NBM) and Random Trees (RT) in landslide susceptibility mapping. The NBM is an advancement of the frequently used Naïve Bayes classifiers, while the RT was built to overcome the limitations of the traditional forest classifiers. A geospatial database for this investigation comprises 148 landslide locations influenced by ten (10) landslide conditioning factors. The factors (Slope Angle, Slopes Elevation, Slope Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile Curvature, Lithology, Soil type, Stream power index (SPI), Sediment transport index (STI), and Rainfall precipitation) were drawn using a Multi Collinearity Decision Making (MCDM) technique. A Frequency Ratio (FR) analysis was used to obtain the relative significance of the factors in the slides. Predictive models were also developed by quantifying these models using data mining techniques. A section of the entire geospatial data (70%) was used as training datasets, while the remaining part of the data (30%) was used to validate the trained datasets. SVM, RT, and NBM algorithms were used to produce predicted datasets from the training datasets. These predicted datasets were used to develop the Landslides Susceptibility Models. A comparative assessment between the two classifiers against the famous traditional learning algorithm, the Support vector machines (SVM), was conducted. Model performance evaluators such as the AUROC, RSME, F-measure, MAE, and ACC were employed to check the predictive capabilities and accuracies of the models. The indices indicated that the SVM model performed better than the other two algorithms in both training and validation datasets. Further analysis and comparison of the models reveal that the new data mining techniques are reliable for landslide susceptibility. Simultaneously, the traditional algorithm is also useful and remains relevant, especially with similar site conditions. This study has provided insights on better planning and development and provision of mitigation strategies and further analysis on landslides in the study area, particularly in cases of limited data availability."
A Novel Model for Landslide Displacement Prediction Based on EDR Selection and Multi-Swarm Intelligence Optimization Algorithm,"Junrong Zhang, Huiming Tang, Dwayne D.

This study aimed to propose a novel prediction model to improve accuracy in landslide prediction, based on the combination of multiple new algorithms. The proposed new method includes three parts: data preparation, multi-swarm intelligence (MSI) optimization, and displacement prediction. In the data preparation, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) is adopted to separate the trend and periodic displacements from the observed cumulative landslide displacement. The frequency component and residual component of reconstructed inducing factors that related to landslide movements are also extracted by the CEEMD and t-test, and then picked out with edit distance on real sequence (EDR) as input variables for the support vector regression (SVR) model. MSI optimization algorithms are used to optimize the SVR model in the MSI optimization; thus, six predictions models can be obtained that can be used in the displacement prediction part. Finally, the trend and periodic displacements are predicted by six optimized SVR models, respectively. The trend displacement and periodic displacement with the highest prediction accuracy are added and regarded as the final prediction result. The case study of the Shiliushubao landslide shows that the prediction results match the observed data well with an improvement in the aspect of average relative error, which indicates that the proposed model can predict landslide displacements with high precision, even when the displacements are characterized by stepped curves that under the influence of multiple time-varying factors."

In so doing, a valid landslide inventory map and thirteen conditioning factors (including elevation, slope aspect, slope degree, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to waterway, distance to road, distance to fault, soil type, land use, lithology, stream power index, and topographic wetness index) form the spatial database within geographic information system (GIS). The used evaluative models comprise a bivariate statistical approach called frequency ratio (FR) and two machine learning tools, namely multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). These models first use landslide and non-landslide records for comprehending the relationship between the landslide occurrence and conditioning factors. Then landslide susceptibility values are predicted for the whole area. The accuracy of the produced susceptibility maps is measured using area under the curve (AUC) index, according to which, the MLPNN (AUC = 0.916) presented the most accurate map, followed by the FR (AUC = 0. 898) and ANFIS (AUC = 0.889). Visual interpretation of the susceptibility maps, FR-based correlation analysis, as well as the importance assessment of conditioning factors, all indicated the significant contribution of the road networks to the crucial susceptibility of landslide. Lastly, an explicit predictive formula is extracted from the implemented MLPNN model for a convenient approximation of landslide susceptibility value."

Atmospheric Correction Thresholds for Ground-Based Radar Interferometry Deformation Monitoring Estimated Using Time Series Analyses,"Tomasz Owerko, Przemysław Kuraś, Łukasz Ortyl",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12142236,https://openalex.org/W3043557154,"Ground-based radar interferometry (GBSAR) is a useful method to control the stability of engineering objects and elements of geographical spaces at risk of deformation or displacement. To secure accurate and credible measurement results, it is crucial to consider atmospheric conditions as they influence the corrections to distance measurements. These conditions are especially important considering the radar bandwidth used. Measurements for the stability of engineering objects are not always performed in locations where meteorological monitoring is prevalent; however, information about the range of variability in atmospheric corrections is always welcome. The authors present a hybrid method to estimate the probable need of atmospheric corrections, which allows partly eliminating false positive alarms of deformations as caused by atmospheric fluctuations. Unlike the numerous publications on atmospheric reductions focused on the current state of the atmosphere, the proposed solution is based on applying a classic machine learning algorithm designed for the SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with covariate at time) time series data model for satellite data shared by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) during the Landsat MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) mission before performing residual estimation during the monitoring phase. Example calculations (proof of concept) were made for ten-year satellite data covering a region for experimental flood bank stability observations as performed using the IBIS-L (Image by Interferometric Survey—Landslide) radar and for target monitoring data (ground measurements)."
Uncertainties in landslide susceptibility prediction modeling: A review on the incompleteness of landslide inventory and its influence rules,"Faming Huang, Daxiong Mao, Shui‐Hua Jiang, Chuangbing Zhou, Xuanmei Fan, Ziqiang Zeng, Filippo Catani, Changshi Yu, Zhilu Chang, Jinsong Huang, Bingchen Jiang, Yijing Li",2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2024.101886,https://openalex.org/W4400188586,"Landslide inventory is an indispensable output variable of landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) modelling. However, the influence of landslide inventory incompleteness on LSP and the transfer rules of LSP resulting error in the model have not been explored. Adopting Xunwu County, China, as an example, the existing landslide inventory is first obtained and assumed to contain all landslide inventory samples under ideal conditions, after which different landslide inventory sample missing conditions are simulated by random sampling. It includes the condition that the landslide inventory samples in the whole study area are missing randomly at the proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%, as well as the condition that the landslide inventory samples in the south of Xunwu County are missing in aggregation. Then, five machine learning models, namely, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are used to perform LSP. Finally, the LSP results are evaluated to analyze the LSP uncertainties under various conditions. In addition, this study introduces various interpretability methods of machine learning model to explore the changes in the decision basis of the RF model under various conditions. Results show that (1) randomly missing landslide inventory samples at certain proportions (10%–50%) may affect the LSP results for local areas. (2) Aggregation of missing landslide inventory samples may cause significant biases in LSP, particularly in areas where samples are missing. (3) When 50% of landslide samples are missing (either randomly or aggregated), the changes in the decision basis of the RF model are mainly manifested in two aspects: first, the importance ranking of environmental factors slightly differs; second, in regard to LSP modelling in the same test grid unit, the weights of individual model factors may drastically vary."
Enhancing landslide management with hyper-tuned machine learning and deep learning models: Predicting susceptibility and analyzing sensitivity and uncertainty,"Mohammed Dahim, Saeed Alqadhi, Javed Mallick",2023,https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1108924,https://openalex.org/W4323566969,"Introduction Natural hazards such as landslides and floods have caused significant damage to properties, natural resources, and human lives. The increased anthropogenic activities in weak geological areas have led to a rise in the frequency of landslides, making landslide management an urgent task to minimize the negative impact. This study aimed to use hyper-tuned machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict landslide susceptibility model (LSM) and provide sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in Aqabat Al-Sulbat Asir region of Saudi Arabia. Methods Random forest (RF) was used as the machine learning model, while deep neural network (DNN) was used as the deep learning model. The models were hyper-tuned using the grid search technique, and the best hypertuned models were used for predicting LSM. The generated models were validated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), F1 and F2 scores, gini value, and precision and recall curve. The DNN based sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was conducted to analyze the influence and uncertainty of the parameters to the landslide. Results Results showed that the RF and DNN models predicted 35.1–41.32 and 15.14–16.2 km 2 areas as high and very high landslide susceptibility zones, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curve showed that the LSM by the DNN model achieved 0.96 of AUC, while the LSM by RF model achieved 0.93 of AUC. The sensitivity analysis results showed that rainfall had the highest sensitivity to the landslide, followed by Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), curvature, slope, soil texture, and lineament density. Discussion Road density and geology map had the highest uncertainty to the landslide prediction.

We extract geospatial features such as slope, aspect, and rainfall over Guangxi, China, and apply an extreme gradient boosting model pre-trained on contiguous United States datasets. The model produces susceptibility maps that indicate landslide probability at different scales. However, the lack of accurate data on historical landslides in Guangxi challenges the model evaluation and comparison between regions. To overcome this, we calibrate the model to fit the local conditions in Guangxi. The calibrated model agrees with the observed landslide locations, implying its capability to capture regional variations in landslide mechanisms. We apply the model at a 30 m resolution along the Heba Expressway and validate it against reports from July 2021 to March 2022. The model correctly predicts five of seven landslide events in this period with a reasonable alarm rate. This framework has the potential for large-scale landslide risk management by informing transportation planning and infrastructure maintenance decisions. More data on landslide timing and human disturbance events may improve the model’s accuracy across diverse geographical areas and terrains."

The existing research has not fully considered the potential impact of the spatial agglomeration and dispersion of landslides on assessments. This issue may cause a systematic evaluation bias when the field investigation data are insufficient, which is common due to limited human resources. Accordingly, this paper proposes two novel strategies, including a clustering algorithm and a preprocessing method, for these two ignored features to strengthen assessments, especially in high-susceptibility regions. Multiple machine learning models are compared in a case study of the city of Bijie (Guizhou Province, China). Then we generate the optimal susceptibility map and conduct two experiments to test the validity of the proposed methods. The primary conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) random forest (RF) was superior to other algorithms in the recognition of high-susceptibility areas and the portrayal of local spatial features; (2) the susceptibility map incorporating spatial feature messages showed a noticeable improvement over the spatial distribution and gradual change of susceptibility, as well as the accurate delineation of critical hazardous areas and the interpretation of historical hazards; and (3) the spatial distribution feature had a significant positive effect on modeling, as the accuracy increased by 5% and 10% after including the spatial agglomeration and dispersion consideration in the RF model, respectively. The benefit of the agglomeration is concentrated in high-susceptibility areas, and our work provides insight to improve the assessment accuracy in these areas, which is critical to risk assessment and prevention activities."

The Development of PSO-ANN and BOA-ANN Models for Predicting Matric Suction in Expansive Clay Soil,"Saeed Davar, Masoud Nobahar, Mohammad Sadik Khan, Farshad Amini",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/math10162825,https://openalex.org/W4295973424,"Disasters have different shapes, and one of them is sudden landslides, which can put the safety of highway users at risk and result in crucial economic damage. Along with the risk of human losses, each day a highway malfunctions causes high expenses to citizens, and repairing a failed highway is a time- and cost-consuming process. Therefore, correct highway functioning can be categorized as a high-priority reliability factor for cities. By detecting the failure factors of highway embankment slopes, monitoring them in real-time, and predicting them, managers can make preventive, preservative, and corrective operations that would lead to continuing the function of intracity and intercity highways. Expansive clay soil causes many infrastructure problems throughout the United States, and much of Mississippi’s highway embankments and fill slopes are constructed of this clay soil, also known as High-Volume Change Clay Soil (HVCCS). Landslides on highway embankments are caused by recurrent volume changes due to seasonal moisture variations (wet-dry cycles), and the moisture content of the HVCCS impacts soil shear strength in a vadose zone. Soil Matric Suction (SMS) is another indication of soil shear strength, an essential element to consider. Machine learning develops high-accuracy models for predicting the SMS. The current work aims to develop hybrid intelligent models for predicting the SMS of HVCCS (known as Yazoo clay) based on field instrumentation data. To achieve this goal, six Highway Slopes (HWS) in Jackson Metroplex, Mississippi, were extensively instrumented to track changes over time, and the field data was analyzed and generated to be used in the proposed models. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a Bayesian Regularization Backpropagation (BR-BP) training algorithm was used, and two intelligent systems, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) were developed to optimize the ANN-BR algorithm for predicting the HWS’ SMS by utilizing 13,690 data points for each variable. Several performance indices, such as coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Square Error (MSE), Variance Account For (VAF), and Regression Error Characteristic (REC), were also computed to analyze the models’ accuracy in prediction outcomes. Based on the analysis results, the PSO-ANN outperformed the BOA-ANN, and both had far better performance than ANN-BR. Moreover, the rainfall had the highest impact on SMS among all other variables and it should be carefully monitored for landslide prediction HWS. The proposed hybrid models can be used for SMS prediction for similar slopes."

Nine physical factors (i.e., age, diameter, depth, slope, length, pipe type, material, pipe form, and connection type) and ten environmental factors (i.e., rainfall, geology, landslide area, building area, population, land cover, groundwater level, traffic volume, distance from the road, and soil type) were used to assess the sewer structural condition employing seventeen ML models. After processing the sewer inspections, 1,159 of 1,449 individual pipelines were used to train the structural condition model. The performance of ML models was validated using the 290 remaining inspected sewer pipes. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve and accuracy (ACC) showed that the Random Forest (AUC-ROC = 77.6% and ACC = 78.3%) is a sensitive model for predicting the condition of sewer pipes in the study area. Based on the RF model, maps of predicted conditions of sewers were generated that may be useful for utilities and water managers to establish future sewer system maintenance strategies."

This study's datasets were constructed in three different compositions where each composition was treated as input in Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic regression model. The first dataset was composed of a 70:30 ratio for training and testing sample points, the second dataset with a 60:40 ratio, and the third with a 50:50 ratio. The performance of each model using each dataset composition was analyzed using various accuracy assessments. This study also considered each topographical factor's effect on model performance by excluding several factors in model construction. From the results, random forest with the first dataset appeared to give the best performance for mapping landslide susceptibility area, shown by the highest Area Under Curve (AUC) value, Coefficient Correlation (CC), and Cohen’s Kappa of 0.96, 0.92 (92%) and 0.84, respectively. Elevation and geological maps were considered as essential variables shown by significant drops in model accuracy assessment when these two factors were separately excluded, while profile curvature was the least essential variable based on the insignificant drop in the model accuracy assessment result."
A machine learning–based approach to regional‐scale mapping of sensitive glaciomarine clay combining airborne electromagnetics and geotechnical data,"Craig W. Christensen, Edward John Harrison, A.A. Pfaffhuber, Alf Kristian Lund",2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/nsg.12166,https://openalex.org/W3164630262,"ABSTRACT Sensitive glaciomarine clays, often referred to as ‘quick clay’, commonly occur in many countries at high, northerly latitudes, causing frequent and occasionally devastating landslides. The salt content of quick clay is strongly correlated to both its shear strength and electrical resistivity. Hence, it can be mapped using electromagnetic methods more efficiently than traditional intrusive methods, the latter of which can often be slow and costly. However, the resistivity signature of quick clay is non‐unique, leading to ambiguous, imprecise interpretations of geophysical models. In this study, we present an improved method for predicting the probability of quick clay using airborne electromagnetics. Using machine learning algorithms, we combine geophysical models with geotechnical data to address the issue of their non‐unique resistivity signature. Beyond resistivity values, the machine learning algorithms use spatial derivatives of resistivity and spatial attributes. We evaluate the performance of this method using data collected from a road construction project in central Norway. Results show that this method is able to make plausible and accurate predictions of quick clay occurrence using as few as 10 boreholes across an area of 14.8 km 2 , and that it outperforms a simple interpretation based on resistivity intervals alone. In addition to a ‘best guess’ categorical classification, these algorithms output probability estimates, and we demonstrate that they are a reliable indication of uncertainty. The accuracy of these predictions also tends to increase as more geotechnical data are included as training data, helping compensate for the limited resolution of the airborne electromagnetics data. Given that the petrophysics of the clays at this test site are consistent with observations in other regions, we expect this method has the potential to make quick clay hazard mapping more efficient by offering valuable early‐phase insights, leading to large time and cost savings for both infrastructure planning and regional hazard mapping."
Application of data mining and machine learning in management accounting information system,Xiaofang Zhang,2021,https://doi.org/10.6180/jase.202110_24(5).0018,https://openalex.org/W3179411029,"ABSTRACT

In the traditional management accounting information processing method, the method used to solve the problem is often fixed due to excessive assumptions. In order to improve its operating efficiency, combined with artificial intelligence information technology, this paper uses data mining algorithms to conduct data acquisition and rule exploration. Moreover, this paper uses statistics, machine learning and other techniques to analyze the correlation between attribute values and transform data into knowledge needed for decision-making. In addition, this paper combines machine learning algorithms to build an intelligent management accounting information system and realizes the close connection between corporate finance and business, which helps to form a closed-loop management between financial analysis, risk management, performance management, and decision-making. Finally, this paper designs experiments to verify the performance of the model. The research results show that the system constructed in this paper satisfies the intelligent demand of accounting information.

In this study, landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) of Murgul district in Artvin province were produced. The study employed tree-based ensemble learning algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). LSM was performed using 13 factors, including altitude, aspect, distance to drainage, distance to faults, distance to roads, land cover, lithology, plan curvature, profile curvature, slope, slope length, topographic position index (TPI), and topographic wetness index (TWI). The study utilized a landslide inventory consisting of 54 landslide polygons. Landslide inventory dataset contained 92,446 pixels with a spatial resolution of 10 m. Consistent with the literature, the majority of landslide pixels (70% – 64,712 pixels) were used for model training, and the remaining portion (30% – 27,734 pixels) was used for model validation. Overall accuracy, precision, recall, F 1-score, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) were considered as validation metrics. LightGBM and XGBoost were found to have better performance in all validation metrics compared to other algorithms. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were utilized to explain and interpret the model outputs. As per the LightGBM algorithm, the most influential factors in the occurrence of landslide in the study area were determined to be altitude, lithology, distance to faults, and aspect, whereas TWI, plan and profile curvature were identified as the least influential factors. Finally, it was concluded that the produced LSMs would provide significant contributions to decision makers in reducing the damages caused by landslides in the study area."
Data-augmented landslide displacement prediction using generative adversarial network,"Qi Ge, Jin Li, Suzanne Lacasse, Hongyue Sun, Zhongqiang Liu",2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2024.01.003,https://openalex.org/W4392601919,"Landslides are destructive natural disasters that cause catastrophic damage and loss of life worldwide. Accurately predicting landslide displacement enables effective early warning and risk management. However, the limited availability of on-site measurement data has been a substantial obstacle in developing data-driven models, such as state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models. To address these challenges, this study proposes a data augmentation framework that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs), a recent advance in generative artificial intelligence (AI), to improve the accuracy of landslide displacement prediction. The framework provides effective data augmentation to enhance limited datasets. A recurrent GAN model, RGAN-LS, is proposed, specifically designed to generate realistic synthetic multivariate time series that mimics the characteristics of real landslide on-site measurement data. A customized moment-matching loss is incorporated in addition to the adversarial loss in GAN during the training of RGAN-LS to capture the temporal dynamics and correlations in real time series data. Then, the synthetic data generated by RGAN-LS is used to enhance the training of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) models for landslide displacement prediction tasks. Results on two landslides in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region show a significant improvement in LSTM model prediction performance when trained on augmented data. For instance, in the case of the Baishuihe landslide, the average root mean square error (RMSE) increases by 16.11%, and the mean absolute error (MAE) by 17.59%. More importantly, the model's responsiveness during mutational stages is enhanced for early warning purposes. However, the results have shown that the static PSO-SVM model only sees marginal gains compared to recurrent models such as LSTM. Further analysis indicates that an optimal synthetic-to-real data ratio (50% on the illustration cases) maximizes the improvements. This also demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of supplementing training data for dynamic models to obtain better results. By using the powerful generative AI approach, RGAN-LS can generate high-fidelity synthetic landslide data. This is critical for improving the performance of advanced ML models in predicting landslide displacement, particularly when there are limited training data. Additionally, this approach has the potential to expand the use of generative AI in geohazard risk management and other research areas."

Around the world, the occurrence of landslides has become one of the greatest threats to human life, property, infrastructure, and natural environments. Despite extensive research and discussions on the spatiotemporal dependence of landslide displacements, there is still a lack of understanding concerning the factors that appear to control displacement distribution in landslides because of their significant variations. This paper implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict displacement following the Moio della Civitella landslide in southern Italy and identify factors that may affect the distribution of movement following the landslide. An interferometric technique, known as permanent scatter interferometry (PSI), has been developed based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery to derive permanent scatter points that can be used to represent the deformation of landslides. This study utilized the GCN regression model applied to PSs points and data reflecting geological and geomorphological factors to extract the interdependency between paired data points, resulting in an adjacency matrix of the interval [0, 0,8). The proposed model outperforms conventional machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as linear regression (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support vector regression (SVR), Decision tree, lasso, and artificial neural network (ANN). The absolute error between the actual and predicted deformation is used to evaluate the proposed model, which is less than 2 millimeters for most test set points."

An Improved Multi-Source Data-Driven Landslide Prediction Method Based on Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph,"Luanjie Chen, Xingtong Ge, Lina Yang, Weichao Li, Ling Peng",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15082126,https://openalex.org/W4366287759,"Landslides pose a significant threat to human lives and property, making the development of accurate and reliable landslide prediction methods essential. With the rapid advancement of multi-source remote sensing techniques and machine learning, remote sensing data-driven landslide prediction methods have attracted increasing attention. However, the lack of an effective and efficient paradigm for organizing multi-source remote sensing data and a unified prediction workflow often results in the weak generalization ability of existing prediction models. In this paper, we propose an improved multi-source data-driven landslide prediction method based on a spatio-temporal knowledge graph and machine learning models. By combining a spatio-temporal knowledge graph and machine learning models, we establish a framework that can effectively organize multi-source remote sensing data and generate unified prediction workflows. Our approach considers the environmental similarity between different areas, enabling the selection of the most adaptive machine learning model for predicting landslides in areas with scarce samples. Experimental results show that our method outperforms machine learning methods, achieving an increase in F1 score by 29% and an improvement in processing efficiency by 93%. Furthermore, by comparing the susceptibility maps generated in real scenarios, we found that our workflow can alleviate the problem of poor prediction performance caused by limited data availability in county-level predictions. This method provides new insights into the development of data-driven landslide evaluation methods, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability."
FR-weighted GeoDetector for landslide susceptibility and driving factors analysis,"Linya Peng, Yangjie Sun, Zhao Zhan, Wenzhong Shi, Min Zhang",2023,https://doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2023.2205001,https://openalex.org/W4367051999,"Landslide susceptibility analysis is an essential tool for landslide hazard management. Correlation analysis of the driving factors before landslide susceptibility analysis is crucial to obtain more accurate results and higher computational efficiency. This article presents an FR-weighted GeoDetector, which can, at different gridding scales, stably screen out the driving factors most relevant to historical landslides in the study area compared to the performance of the original GeoDetector. The correlation analysis result shows that the most relevant seven conditioning factors to historical landslides in the study area are: lithology, distance to road, elevation, slope, STI, SPI, and distance to faults. Four machine learning models (logistic regression [LR], random forest [RF], artificial neural network [ANN], and Xgboost) are implemented for landslide susceptibility analysis, demonstrating that such models can achieve higher accuracy with features filtered by the FR-weighted GeoDetector than with all features. The Xgboost models trained on seven and 12 features were used to generate landslide susceptibility maps. The overlay with historical landslides showed that the models trained on seven features generated a more reasonable landslide susceptibility map, proving that selecting crucial landslide conditioning factors is a better solution than using a full range of landslide conditioning factors."
Mapping Pluvial Flood-Induced Damages with Multi-Sensor Optical Remote Sensing: A Transferable Approach,"Arnaud Cerbelaud, Gwendoline Blanchet, Laure Roupioz, Pascal Breil, Xavier Briottet",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15092361,https://openalex.org/W4367627273,"Pluvial floods caused by extreme overland flow inland account for half of all flood damage claims each year along with fluvial floods. In order to increase confidence in pluvial flood susceptibility mapping, overland flow models need to be intensively evaluated using observations from past events. However, most remote-sensing-based flood detection techniques only focus on the identification of degradations and/or water pixels in the close vicinity of overflowing streams after heavy rainfall. Many occurrences of pluvial-flood-induced damages such as soil erosion, gullies, landslides and mudflows located further away from the stream are thus often unrevealed. To fill this gap, a transferable remote sensing fusion method called FuSVIPR, for Fusion of Sentinel-2 &amp; Very high resolution Imagery for Pluvial Runoff, is developed to produce damage-detection maps. Based on very high spatial resolution optical imagery (from Pléiades satellites or airborne sensors) combined with 10 m change images from Sentinel-2 satellites, the Random Forest and U-net machine/deep learning techniques are separately trained and compared to locate pluvial flood footprints on the ground at 0.5 m spatial resolution following heavy weather events. In this work, three flash flood events in the Aude and Alpes-Maritimes departments in the South of France are investigated, covering over more than 160 km2 of rural and periurban areas between 2018 and 2020. Pluvial-flood-detection accuracies hover around 75% (with a minimum area detection ratio for annotated ground truths of 25%), and false-positive rates mostly below 2% are achieved on all three distinct events using a cross-site validation framework. FuSVIPR is then further evaluated on the latest devastating flash floods of April 2022 in the Durban area (South Africa), without additional training. Very good agreement with the impact maps produced in the context of the International Charter “Space and Major Disasters” are reached with similar performance figures. These results emphasize the high generalization capability of this method to locate pluvial floods at any time of the year and over diverse regions worldwide using a very high spatial resolution visible product and two Sentinel-2 images. The resulting impact maps have high potential for helping thorough evaluation and improvement of surface water inundation models and boosting extreme precipitation downscaling at a very high spatial resolution."
Identification of groundwater potential zones of Idukki district using remote sensing and GIS-based machine-learning approach,"Zohaib Ahmed Khan, Bharat Jhamnani",2023,https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2023.134,https://openalex.org/W4378905432,"Abstract Kerala's Idukki district, which is situated on the Western Ghats of India, is susceptible to flooding and landslides. As a result of the 2018 Kerala floods, this disaster-prone region experienced drought conditions. In order to lessen the effects of future disasters, it is also necessary to identify and evaluate the district's groundwater potential (GWP). This work used three machine-learning (ML) algorithms – Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Gradient Boosting (GB) – to model and produce GWP zonation maps for the Idukki district. Fourteen conditioning factors including elevation, slope, curvature, Topographic Roughness Index, lineament density, soil, geology, geomorphology, Topographic Wetness Index, Sediment Transport Index, drainage density, rainfall, land-use/land-cover (LULC), and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index were adopted as input parameters in the modelling. All showed prominence when they were examined for feature importance using the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. The RF model outperformed the other two ML models in terms of fit, with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.92, while the GB and AdaBoost models displayed less fit, with AUC values of 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. GWP maps produced by each model were reclassified into five zones – very high to very low – it was discovered that the zones were evenly spread throughout the Idukki region."
A Novel Heterogeneous Ensemble Framework Based on Machine Learning Models for Shallow Landslide Susceptibility Mapping,"Haozhe Tang, Changming Wang, Silong An, Qingyu Wang, Cheng‐Lin Jiang",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15174159,https://openalex.org/W4386119820,"Landslides are devastating natural disasters that seriously threaten human life and property. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) plays a key role in landslide hazard management. Machine learning (ML) models are widely used in LSM but suffer from limitations such as overfitting and unreliable accuracy. To improve the classification performance of a single machine learning (ML) model, this study selects logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and proposes a novel heterogeneous ensemble framework based on Bayesian optimization (BO), namely, stratified weighted averaging (SWA), to test its applicability in a typical landslide area in Yanbian Prefecture, China. Firstly, a dataset consisting of 1531 historical landslides was collected from field investigations and historical records, and a spatial database containing 16 predisposing factors was established. The dataset was divided into a training set and a test set in a ratio of 7:3. The results showed that SWA effectively improved the Accuracy, AUC, and robustness of the model compared to a single ML model. The SWA achieved the best classification results (Accuracy = 91.39% and AUC = 0.967). To verify the generalization ability of SWA, we selected published landslide datasets from Yanshan country and Yongxin country in China for testing. SWA also performed well, with an AUC of 0.871 and 0.860, respectively. As indicated by shapely values (SVs), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the factor that has the greatest impact on landslide occurrence. The landslide susceptibility maps obtained from this study will provide an effective reference program for land use planning and disaster prevention and mitigation projects in Yanbian Prefecture, China."

The department of Aube in France is well known for several major landslide occurrences. This study focuses on the assessment of Landslide Susceptibility (LS) using the Frequency Ratio (FR) as a statistical method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method, and Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) as machine learning methods in the Aube department, northeast of France. Subsequently, the thematic layers of eight landslide causative factors, including distance to hydrography, density of quarries, elevation, slope, lithology, distance to roads, distance to faults, and rainfall, were generated in the geographic information system (GIS) environment. The thematic layers were integrated and processed to map landslide susceptibility in the study area. On the other hand, an inventory of landslides was carried out based on the database created by the French Geological Survey (BRGM), where 157 landslide occurrences were selected, and then RF and kNN models were trained to generate landslide maps (LSMs) of the study area. The generated maps were assessed by using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC). Subsequently, the accuracy assessment of the FR model revealed more accurate results (AUC = 66.0%) than AHP, outperforming the latter by 6%, while machine learning models results showed that RF gave better results than kNN (&lt;7.3%) with AUC = 95%. Following the analysis of LS mapping results, lithology, distance to the hydrographic network, distance to roads, and elevation were the four main factors controlling landslide susceptibility in the study area. Future mitigation and protection activities within the Aube department can benefit from the present study mapping results, implicating an optimized land management for decision-makers."
Estimating the Quality of the Most Popular Machine Learning Algorithms for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in 2018 Mw 7.5 Palu Earthquake,"Siyuan Ma, Xiaoyi Shao, Chong Xu",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15194733,https://openalex.org/W4387106493,"The Mw 7.5 Palu earthquake that occurred on 28 September 2018 (UTC 10:02) on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, triggered approximately 15,600 landslides, causing about 4000 fatalities and widespread destruction. The primary objective of this study is to perform landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) associated with this event and assess the performance of the most widely used machine learning algorithms of logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Eight controlling factors were considered, including elevation, hillslope gradient, aspect, relief, distance to rivers, peak ground velocity (PGV), peak ground acceleration (PGA), and lithology. To evaluate model uncertainty, training samples were randomly selected and used to establish the models 20 times, resulting in 20 susceptibility maps for different models. The quality of the landslide susceptibility maps was evaluated using several metrics, including the mean landslide susceptibility index (LSI), modelling uncertainty, and predictive accuracy. The results demonstrate that both models effectively capture the actual distribution of landslides, with areas exhibiting high LSI predominantly concentrated on both sides of the seismogenic fault. The RF model exhibits less sensitivity to changes in training samples, whereas the LR model displays significant variation in LSI with sample changes. Overall, both models demonstrate satisfactory performance; however, the RF model exhibits superior predictive capability compared to the LR model."
A Novel Estimation of the Composite Hazard of Landslides and Flash Floods Utilizing an Artificial Intelligence Approach,"Mohamed Wahba, Mustafa El-Rawy, Nassir Al‐Arifi, Mahmoud M.

This research investigates the hazards of landslides and floods in two adopted basins in the Yamaguchi and Shimane prefectures, Japan. This study utilized ten environmental variables alongside categories representing landslide-prone, non-landslide, flooded, and non-flooded areas. Employing a machine-learning approach, namely, a LASSO regression model, we generated Landslide Hazard Maps (LHM), Flood Hazard Maps (FHM), and a Composite Hazard Map (CHM). The LHM identified flood-prone low-lying areas in the northwest and southeast, while central and northwest regions exhibited higher landslide susceptibility. Both LHM and FHM were classified into five hazard levels. Landslide hazards predominantly covered high- to moderate-risk areas, since the high-risk areas constituted 38.8% of the study region. Conversely, flood hazards were mostly low to moderate, with high- and very high-risk areas at 10.49% of the entire study area. The integration of LHM and FHM into CHM emphasized high-risk regions, underscoring the importance of tailored mitigation strategies. The accuracy of the model was assessed by employing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve method, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were determined. The LHM and FHM exhibited an exceptional AUC of 99.36% and 99.06%, respectively, signifying the robust efficacy of the model. The novelty in this study is the generation of an integrated representation of both landslide and flood hazards. Finally, the produced hazard maps are essential for policymaking to address vulnerabilities to landslides and floods."

Precise and timely landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is significant for landslide hazard assessment and mitigation in earthquake-affected areas. State-of-the-art LSM approaches connect causative factors from various sources without considering the fusion of different information at the data modal level. To exploit the complementary information of different modalities and boost LSM accuracy, this study presents a new LSM model that integrates data modality and machine learning methods. The presented method first groups causative factors into different modal types based on their intrinsic characteristics, followed by the calculation of the pairwise similarity of modal data. The similarities of different modalities are fused using nonlinear graph fusion to generate a unified graph, which is subsequently classified using different machine learning methods to produce final LSM. Experimental results suggest that the presented method achieves higher performance than existing LSM methods. This study provides a new solution for producing precise LSM from a fusion perspective that can be applied to minimize the potential landslide risk and for sustainable use of erosion-prone slopes."

We then used a GIS database to construct and validate the proposed RandSub-DT model. The model performance was assessed using a confusion matrix and a set of statistical measures. The result showed that the RandSub-DT model with the classification accuracy of 90.34% in the training dataset and the prediction capability of 77.48% had a high performance for landslide prediction. This research proved that an ensemble of the C4.5 and RS provided a highly accurate estimate of landslide susceptibility in the research area."
Patagonian Andes Landslides Inventory: The Deep Learning’s Way to Their Automatic Detection,"Bastían Morales, Ángel García‐Pedrero, Elizabet Lizama, Mario Lillo‐Saavedra, Consuelo Gonzalo‐Martín, Ningsheng Chen, Marcelo Somos‐Valenzuela",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14184622,https://openalex.org/W4296350038,"Landslide inventories are crucial to studying the dynamics, associated risks, and effects of these geomorphological processes on the evolution of mountainous landscapes. The production of landslide maps is mainly based on manual visual interpretation methods of aerial and satellite images combined with field surveys. In recent times, advances in machine learning methods have made it possible to explore new semi-automated landslide detection methodologies using remotely detected images. In this sense, developing new artificial intelligence models based on Deep Learning (DL) opens up an excellent opportunity to automate this arduous process. Although the Andes mountain range is one of the most geomorphologically active areas on the planet, the few investigations that use DL mainly focus on mountain ranges in Europe and Asia. One of the main reasons is the low density of landslide data available in the Andean areas, making it difficult to experiment with DL models requiring large data volumes. In this work, we seek to narrow the existing gap in the availability of landslide inventories in the area of the Patagonian Andes. In addition, the feasibility and efficiency of DL techniques are studied to develop landslide detection models in the Andes from the generated datasets. To achieve this goal, we generated in a manual process a datasets of 10,000 landslides for northern Chilean Patagonia (42–45°S), being the largest freely accessible landslide datasets in this region. We implement a machine learning model, through DL, to detect landslides in optical images of the Sentinel-2 constellation using a model based on the DeepLabv3+ architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning network for semantic segmentation. Our results indicate that the algorithm detects landslides with an accuracy of 0.75 at the object level. For its part, the segmentation reaches a precision of 0.86, a recall of 0.74, and an F1-score of 0.79. The correlation of the segmentation measured through the Matthews correlation coefficient shows a value of 0.59, and the geometric similarity of the correctly detected landslides measured through the Jaccard score reaches 0.70. Although the model shows a good response in the testing area, errors are generated that can be explained by geometric and spectral relationships, which should be solved through new training approaches and data sets."
Rock slope displacement prediction based on multi-source information fusion and SSA-DELM model,"Song Jiang, Huan Liu, Lian Min-jie, Caiwu Lu, Sai Zhang, Jingyuan Li, PengCheng Li",2022,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.982069,https://openalex.org/W4297541831,"In order to solve the inefficient use of multi-source heterogeneous data information cross fusion and the low accuracy of prediction of landslide displacement, the current research proposed a new prediction model combining variable selection, sparrow search algorithm, and deep extreme learning machine. A cement mine in Fengxiang, Shaanxi Province, was studied as a case. The study first identified the variables related to landslide displacement of rock slope, and removed redundant variables by using Pearson correlation and gray correlation analysis. To avoid the impacts of random input weights and random thresholds in the DELM model, the SSA algorithm is used to optimize the model’s parameters, which can generate the optimal parameter combinations. The results showed an enhanced generalization ability of the model by removal of redundant variables by Pearson correlation and gray correlation analysis, and higher accuracy in the prediction of landside displacement of rock slope by SSA-DELM compared to other traditional machine learning algorithms. The current study is significant in the literature on rock slope disaster analysis."
Submarine Landslide Susceptibility and Spatial Distribution Using Different Unsupervised Machine Learning Models,"Xing Du, Yongfu Sun, Yupeng Song, Zongxiang Xiu, Zhi-Ming Su",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/app122010544,https://openalex.org/W4306836462,"A submarine landslide is a well-known geohazard that can cause significant damage to offshore engineering facilities. Most standard predicting and mapping methods require expert knowledge, supervision, and fieldwork. In this research, the main objective was to analyze the potential of unsupervised machine learning methods and compare the performance of three different unsupervised machine learning models (k-means, spectral clustering, and hierarchical clustering) in modeling the susceptibility of the submarine landslide. Nine groups of geological factors were selected as the input parameters, which were obtained through field surveys. To estimate submarine landslide susceptibility, all input factors were separated into three or four groups based on data features and environmental variables. Finally, the goodness-of-fit and accuracy of models were validated with both internal metrics (Calinski–Harabasz index, silhouette index, and Davies–Bouldin index) and external metrics (existing landslide distribution, hydrodynamic distribution, and liquefication distribution). The findings of k-means, spectral clustering, and hierarchical clustering performed commendably and accurately in forecasting the submarine landslide susceptibility. Spectral clustering has the greatest congruence with environmental geology parameters. Therefore, the unsupervised machine learning model can be used in submarine-landslide-predicting studies, and the spectral clustering method performed best. Furthermore, machine learning can improve submarine landslide mapping in the future with the development of models and the extension of geological data related to submarine landslides."

The nowcasting of coseismic landslides is crucial for planning land management, development, and urbanization in mountainous areas. Taking Wenchuan County in Western Sichuan Plateau (WPS) as the study area, a landslide inventory was built using historical records. Herein, eight causative factors were selected for a library of factors, and then a landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) was performed based on the machine learning techniques of Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, respectively. The prediction abilities of the above two LSM models were assessed using the area under curve (AUC) value of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, precision, recall ratio, accuracy, and specificity. The performances of both machine learning techniques were found to be excellent, but RF outperformed in accuracy. There were still some differences between the models’ performances shown by the results: RF (AUC = 0.966) outperformed ANN (AUC = 0.914). The RF model demonstrated a higher degree of correlation between the areas classified as very low and high susceptibility in comparison to the ANN model. The results provided a theoretical framework upon which machine learning applications could be applied (e.g., RF and ANN), a reliable and low-cost tool to assess landslide susceptibility. This comparative study will provide a useful description of earthquake-induced landslides in the study area, which can be used to anticipate the features of landslides in the future, and have played a very important role in proper anthropogenic activities, resource management, and infrastructural development of the mountainous areas."
Rainfall-Induced Landslides from Initialization to Post-Failure Flows: Stochastic Analysis with Machine Learning,"Haoding Xu, Xuzhen He, Daichao Sheng",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/math10234426,https://openalex.org/W4309852211,"Rainfall-induced landslides represent a severe hazard around the world due to their sudden occurrence, as well as their widespread influence and runout distance. Considering the spatial variability of soil, stochastic analysis is often conducted to give a probability description of the runout. However, rainfall-induced landslides are complex and time-consuming for brute-force Monte Carlo analyses. Therefore, new methods are required to improve the efficiency of stochastic analysis. This paper presents a framework to investigate the influence and runout distance of rainfall-induced landslides with a two-step simulation approach. The complete process, from the initialization of instability to the post-failure flow, is simulated. The rainfall infiltration process and initialization of instability are first solved with a coupled hydro-mechanical finite element model. The post-failure flow is simulated using the coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian method, wherein the soil can flow freely in fixed Eulerian meshes. An equivalent-strength method is used to connect two steps by considering the effective stress of unsaturated soil. A rigorous method has been developed to accurately quantify the influence and runout distance via Eulerian analyses. Several simulations have been produced, using three-dimensional analyses to study the shapes of slopes and using stochastic analysis to consider uncertainty and the spatial variability of soils. It was found that a two-dimensional analysis assuming plain strain is generally conservative and safe in design, but care must be taken to interpret 2D results when the slope is convex in the longitudinal direction. The uncertainty and spatial variability of soils can lead to the statistic of influence and runout distance. The framework of using machine-learning models as surrogate models is effective in stochastic analysis of this problem and can greatly reduce computational effort."
Landslide Classification from Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Using Convolutional Neural Network with Multichannel Information,"Shingo Mabu, Yoshiaki Nakayama, Takashi Kuremoto",2020,https://doi.org/10.2299/jsp.24.61,https://openalex.org/W3011874232,"Detection of disaster-stricken areas using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is important in countries and regions with heavy rain and earthquakes. Although it is important to immediately find disaster-stricken areas when a disaster occurs, it takes time to read SAR images and also needs experience and expertise. Therefore, machine learning, especially deep learning, is expected to be applied to the classification of disaster-stricken areas. Classification using deep learning is often executed on patch images of local areas. However, patch-based classification would miss information on the surrounding areas such as topographic features. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to the classification of SAR images using the following techniques. When making the images input to a CNN, two multichannel image generation methods, i.e, a zero-padding method and map-concatenation method, are used, where the target areas to be classified and their surrounding areas are combined to form multichannel images. In the experiments, the zero-padding method and map-concatenation method are evaluated by the classification performance of SAR images that cover the northern Kyushu area in Japan, where large-scale landslides due to heavy rain occurred in 2017. Through the experiments, we clarify the appropriate CNN structures with multichannel information for landslide classification."

Damage modelling is a prerequisite for quantitative risk estimations, yet many procedures still rely on expert knowledge, and empirical studies investigating damage from compound natural hazards hardly exist. A nationwide building survey in Peru after the El Niño event 2017 – which caused intense rainfall, ponding water, flash floods and landslides – enables us to apply data-mining methods for statistical groundwork, using explanatory features generated from remote sensing products and open data. We separate regions of different dominant characteristics through unsupervised clustering, and investigate feature importance rankings for classifying damage via supervised machine learning. Besides the expected effect of precipitation, the classification algorithms select the topographic wetness index as most important feature, especially in low elevation areas. The slope length and steepness factor ranks high for mountains and canyons. Partial dependence plots further hint at amplified vulnerability in rural areas. An example of an empirical damage probability map, developed with a random forest model, is provided to demonstrate the technical feasibility."

Such technologies provide accurate and high-resolution n-dimensional spatial representations of our physical world, known as 3D point clouds, that are mainly used for visualization and monitoring purposes. To extract knowledge from point clouds and inform decision-making within rock slope management systems, semantic injection through automated processes is necessary. In this paper, we propose a model that utilizes a segmentation procedure which delivers segments ready to classify and be retained or rejected according to complementary knowledge-based filter criteria. First, we provide relevant voxel-based features based on the local dimensionality, orientation, and topology and partition them in an assembly of homogenous segments. Subsequently, we build a decision tree that utilizes geometrical, topological, and contextual information and enables the classification of a multi-hazard railway rock slope section in British Columbia, Canada into classes involved in landslide risk management. Finally, the approach is compared to machine learning integrating recent featuring strategies for rock slope classification with limited training data (which is usually the case). This alternative to machine learning semantic segmentation approaches reduces substantially the model size and complexity and provides an adaptable framework for tailored decision-making systems leveraging rock slope semantics."

Machine-learning algorithms offer an objective alternative to traditional methods of identifying such volcanoseismic signals, because they are able to handle quickly large amounts of data, while requiring little input from the user. In this work, we combine permutation entropy and centroid as well as dominant frequency with supervised machine learning to evaluate their potential in identifying volcanic tremor and lahar signals recorded during the 2009 Redoubt volcano eruption. The particular dataset was chosen for the reason that the properties and occurrence times of the volcanoseismic signals during the eruption are well known from previous studies. We find that the selected features can effectively discriminate both types of signals against the seismic background, especially for stations that are near the source. Results show that the identification success rate for volcanic tremor reaches up to 96%, whereas this rate becomes up to 91% for lahar signals. The calculation of the features as well as the application of the machine-learning algorithms is fast, allowing their implementation in the operational environment of a volcano observatory during a volcanic crisis. Finally, the proposed methodology can potentially be used to objectively identify other emergent seismic signals such as tectonic tremor along subduction zones, glacial tremor, or seismic signals generated during landslides."

In the present study, a spatially explicit deep learning neural network (DNN) based landslide susceptibility model for Wayanad district of Kerala state in India has been developed and it is compared with conventional random forest machine-learning model. The Wayanad was severely affected by devasting landslides during 2018 extreme climatic event and absence of an accurate landslide susceptibility model caused extensive causalities. A geospatial database was developed using 263 previous landslides event locations and twelve geo-environmental variables such as lithology, soil texture, land use/ land cover, slope angle, slope aspect, topographic wetness index, distance from the road, distance from the streams, distance from the lineaments, convergence index, profile and plan curvatures were used for susceptibility modelling. The present investigation used search grid to obtain best hyper tuning parameters and training data is split for 5-fold cross validation. Subsequently the best model is chosen based on minimal log loss, RMSE and maximum area under curve values (AUC) value for final prediction. The results are validated with receiver operating characteristics curve with AUC (ROC-AUC) and confusion matrix-based parameters. Results showed that DNN outweigh RF model with 93.4% (AUC=0.934) accuracy over 91.1% in training frame. In validation section DNN obtained 88.7% accuracy while RF shows only 85%. It is also noted that DNN shows better spatial pattern in predicting the probability of landslide occurrence whereas a spatial overfitting is found in RF model. The proposed DNN model is trust worthy and can be used for future hazard mitigation and land use planning in the study area."
Projecting sediment export from two highly glacierized alpine catchments under climate change: exploring non-parametric regression as an analysis tool,"Lena Katharina Schmidt, Till Francke, Peter Martin Grosse, Axel Bronstert",2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-139-2024,https://openalex.org/W4391494143,"Abstract. Future changes in suspended sediment export from deglaciating high-alpine catchments affect downstream hydropower reservoirs, flood hazard, ecosystems and water quality. Yet, quantitative projections of future sediment export have so far been hindered by the lack of process-based models that can take into account all relevant processes within the complex systems determining sediment dynamics at the catchment scale. As a promising alternative, machine-learning (ML) approaches have recently been successfully applied to modeling suspended sediment yields (SSYs). This study is the first, to our knowledge, exploring a machine-learning approach to derive sediment export projections until the year 2100. We employ quantile regression forest (QRF), which proved to be a powerful method to model past SSYs in previous studies, for two nested glaciated high-alpine catchments in the Ötztal, Austria, above gauge Vent (98.1 km2) and gauge Vernagt (11.4 km2). As predictors, we use temperature and precipitation projections (EURO-CORDEX) and discharge projections (AMUNDSEN physically based hydroclimatological and snow model) for the two gauges. We address uncertainties associated with the known limitation of QRF that underestimates can be expected if values in the projection period exceed the range represented in the training data (out-of-observation-range days, OOOR). For this, we assess the frequency and extent of these exceedances and the sensitivity of the resulting mean annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) estimates. We examine the resulting SSY projections for trends, the estimated timing of peak sediment and changes in the seasonal distribution. Our results show that the uncertainties associated with the OOOR data points are small before 2070 (max. 3 % change in estimated mean annual SSC). Results after 2070 have to be treated more cautiously as OOOR data points occur more frequently, and glaciers are projected to have (nearly) vanished by then in some projections, which likely substantially alters sediment dynamics in the area. The resulting projections suggest decreasing sediment export at both gauges in the coming decades, regardless of the emission scenario, which implies that peak sediment has already passed or is underway. This is linked to substantial decreases in discharge volumes, especially during the glacier melt phase in late summer, as a result of increasing temperatures and thus shrinking glaciers. Nevertheless, high(er) annual yields can occur in response to heavy summer precipitation, and both developments would need to be considered in managing sediments, as well as e.g., flood hazard. While we chose the predictors to act as proxies for sediment-relevant processes, future studies are encouraged to try and include geomorphological changes more explicitly, e.g., changes in connectivity, landsliding, rockfalls or vegetation colonization, as these could improve the reliability of the projections."

However, existing research tends to generate these samples in feature space, posing challenges in field validation, or using physics-informed models, thereby limiting their applicability. The rapid progress of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology may bridge this gap by offering satellite images with extensive area coverage and precise surface deformation measurements at millimeter scales. Here, we propose an InSAR-based sampling strategy to generate absence samples for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Badong–Zigui area near the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. We achieve this by employing a Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) InSAR to generate the annual average ground deformation. Subsequently, we select absence samples from slopes with very slow deformation. Logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest models demonstrate improvement when using InSAR-based absence samples, indicating enhanced accuracy in reflecting non-landslide conditions. Furthermore, we compare different integration methods to integrate InSAR into ML models, including absence sampling, joint training, overlay weights, and their combination, finding that utilizing all three methods simultaneously optimally improves landslide susceptibility models."

Increased human activity in landslide-prone areas has been a major contributor to the risk of landslide occurrences. Therefore, machine learning has been used in landslide studies to develop a landslide predictive model. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the most suitable sampling ratio for the predictive landslide model in the Langat River Basin (LRB) using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The landslide inventory was divided randomly into training and testing datasets using four sampling ratios (50:50, 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20). A total of 12 landslide conditioning factors were considered in this study, including the elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topography wetness index (TWI), distance to the road, distance to the river, distance to faults, soil, lithology, land use, and rainfall. The evaluation model was performed using certain statistical measures and area under the curve (AUC). Finally, the most suitable predictive model was chosen based on the model validation results using the compound factor (CF) method. Based on the results, the predictive model with an 80:20 ratio indicates a realistic finding and was classified as the first rank among others. The AUC value for the training dataset is 0.931, while the AUC value for the testing dataset is 0.964. These attempts will help a great deal when it comes to choosing the best ratio of training samples to testing samples to create a reliable and complete landslide prediction model for the LRB."

Various factors, such as goaf, land subsidence, slope structure, formation lithology, and various indicators are used as input data sources, and artificial neural network (ANN) datasets are used for training to establish a pre-training model. Using the pre-training model, the mining landslide sensitivity evaluation model based on transfer learning is established. In order to demonstrate the performance of transfer learning more intuitively, the neural network is introduced to evaluate the evaluation model. The test results show that transfer learning can achieve a transfer effect higher than 0.95, and the regional distributions of highest landslide sensitivity calculated based on self-transfer learning, direct push transfer learning, and inductive transfer learning are 31.33, 35.50, and 33.75%, respectively, which further deduced that inductive transfer learning can be used for evaluating an LSP model."

The global prediction results were then validated using additional regional landslide inventories, including three countries, three provinces, and two prefecture-level datasets. Moreover, the global prediction results of 90 m are used to improve the performance of regional LSP. Specifically, the low-and very low-prone areas in the global prediction results were used as non-landslide samples for susceptibility modeling. Results demonstrated that the model achieved a better performance than original global prediction results. We believe that this study will be able to reliably promote the application of intelligent learning methods in global LSP."

The incidence and recurrence of landslides are conditioned by several aspects related to soil properties, geological structure, climatic conditions, soil cover, and water flow. Precisely, Colombia is one of the most affected by this type of natural hazard, as well as by floods, since they are the natural phenomena that bring with them the most severe risks for communities. In this work, we articulated the statistical approach of the landslide conditioning factors, Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), and Geographic Information System (GIS), evaluating a flexible and agile methodology to estimate the landslide susceptibility defining areas prone to the landslide occurrence. The MLA were validated in a case study in the “La Liboriana” River basin, located in the Municipality of Salgar in the Colombian mountains Andes where Landslide Susceptibility Maps (LSMs) were obtained. The obtained MLA results hold immense potential in the field of regional landslide mapping, facilitating the development of effective strategies aimed at minimizing the devastating impacts on human lives, infrastructure, and the natural environment. By leveraging these findings, proactive measures can be devised to safeguard vulnerable areas, mitigate risks, and ensure the safety and well-being of communities. Seven supervised MLA were employed, two regression algorithms (Logistic) and five decision tree algorithms (Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees [RPART], Conditional Inference Trees [CTREE], Random Forest [RF], Ranger, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm [XGBoost]). The LSMs were produced for each MLA. Considering different performance metrics, the RF model yields the best classification accuracy with an area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 95% and 90% of accuracy, providing the most representative results. Finally, the contribution of each landslide conditioning factor on predictions with RF model is explained using the SHAP method."

The modeling process is relatively complicated and multi-models cannot be integrated. With regard to this issue, this study develops a Python system for automatic assessment of regional landslide susceptibility. The Python system implements landslide susceptibility assessment through three modules: geographic data processing, machine learning modeling and result evaluation analysis. For geographic data processing, ten landslide influencing factors can be used to construct an evaluation factor dataset and reclassify the thematic maps based on the frequency ratio method. Four built-in machine learning models (logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) are integrated into the system to complete susceptibility modeling and calculation. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves can be automatically generated to evaluate the accuracy. The system was then applied into Lantian County in Shaanxi Province as a demonstration example. The results show that the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of the four models are 0.838 (LR)、0.882 (SVM)、0.809 (MLP) and 0.812 (XGBoost), respectively, indicating that the SVM model was the most suitable model for landslide susceptibility assessment in Lantian County in the Loess Plateau of China. The system has now been made open source on Github, which can effectively improve the efficiency of regional landslide susceptibility assessment, especially provide tools for data processing and modeling for non-professionals."

The future landslide risk predicting indicated a significant increase in the Very High and High risk areas, especially in 2092. The application of the forest-related adaptation indices based on the policy scenario showed that in 2050, the effect was not pronounced, but in 2092, when the risk of landslides was much higher, the effect increased significantly. In particular, the effect was remarkable in the Seoul metropolitan and southern coastal regions. Even with the same adaptive capacity, it exerted a larger effect on the enhanced disasters. Our results suggest that the enhancement of adaptive capacity can reduce landslide risk up to 70% in a Very High risk region. In conclusion, it implies an importance to respond to the intensifying climate disasters, and abundant follow-up studies are expected to appear in the future."

For conducting this research study, Logchina area of Bhutan is considered. A landslide inventory map (LIM) with a total of 148 landslide sites was identified using Google Earth. Subsequently, the locations were classified into different sets: 70% (104 locations) used for the training purpose and 30% (44 locations) used for the testing of the overall processes occurring. Additionally, 20 landslide condition factors (geological background, hydrological aspects, topographic features, soil type and LULC) took to making landslide susceptibility maps. Multicollinearity test adopted for the collinearity check, which indicates all of the 20 considered conditioning factors are independent, means no collinearity exited. Finally, the LSMs were prepared and mapped using four models and then divided into various classes as: Very High, High, Moderate, Low and Very Low. The AUC values of ROC display 0.88, 0.9, 0.81 and 0.86 for RF, REPTree, RF-Bagging and RPTree-Bagging, respectively. Moreover, they displayed that the rates of prediction were 0.9, 0.91, 0.84 and 0.88 for RF, REPTree, RF-Bagging and RPTree-Bagging, respectively. Thus, the RF-Bagging model has the highest AUC, which came out to be the most precise technique among various other methods applied in the study area. Apart from this validation, the R-index values indicated for the very high susceptibility class in the RF, REPTree, RF-Bagging and RPTree-Bagging maps are 90%, 94.44%, 63.33% and 68.89%, respectively."

Exploring aspects affecting the predicted capacity of landslide susceptibility based on machine learning technology,"Qiang Liu, Aiping Tang",2022,https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2088863,https://openalex.org/W4282842090,"This study reported the causes of prediction uncertainty in landslide susceptibility, based on machine learning. The landslide inventory and conditioning factors were first prepared. Thereafter, factor analysis, including the effectiveness, multicollinearity, and importance was performed for the subsequent susceptibility modeling. Finally, the predicted capacity was explored in terms of model performance and map performance. Investigation indicates that landslides are focused on the central and southeastern part of the study area, displaying the characteristics of small-scale and shallow sliding. The difference in the ML algorithm, kernel functions, the selection of base-classifier, the evaluation indicators of performance, and even the factor zonation results in difficulties in determining the optimal ML model. Besides, the DT-Boosting keeps the high AUC value, 0.981 and 0.862 respectively in the training and test phases, while the RF holds a highly robust in terms of fluctuation characteristics. Indeed, the susceptibility map generated by RBF-ANN can better capture the difference in landslide susceptibility, with the D-value of 7.9. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the uncertainty of the predicted capacity in ML-based landslide susceptibility."

The model was used to map the landslide susceptibility of the Anninghe fault zone in Sichuan Province, China. Based on this, 12 conditioning factors associated with landslides were considered, namely, altitude, slope angle, cutting depth, slope aspect, relief amplitude, stream power index (SPI), gully density, lithology, rainfall, road density, distance to fault, and peak ground acceleration (PGA). The overall performance of the two resulting models was tested using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), area under the ROC curve (AUC), Cohen’s kappa coefficient, and five statistical evaluation measures. The success rates of the ACO-PSO-SVM model and the SVM model were 0.898 and 0.814, respectively, while the prediction rates of the two models were 0.887 and 0.804, respectively. The results show that the ACO-PSO-SVM model yields better overall performance and accurate results than the SVM model. Therefore, in conclusion, the ACO-PSO-SVM model can be applied as a new promising method for landslide susceptibility mapping in subsequent studies.

Machine learning with a susceptibility index-based sampling strategy for landslide susceptibility assessment,"Leilei Liu, Yili Zhang, Shaohe Zhang, Biao Shu, Ting Xiao",2022,https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2102221,https://openalex.org/W4285493955,"The past landslides from landslide inventory are essential for machine learning (ML)-based landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA). They determine not only the positive samples (characterized by the past landslides) but also the negative samples (randomly generated based on past landslides) for training and validating the ML models. However, the number of past landslides is often limited because of the constraints of time, budget, and resources available, etc. In other words, the available data for establishing landslide susceptibility ML models are limited, which indicates that the accuracy and reliability of the corresponding models are insufficient. This article, therefore, proposes using a new landslide susceptibility index-based sampling strategy to enhance the positive and negative samples for model training and validation to reach an improved ML-based LSA. To realize this idea, landslide susceptibility analysis based on initial datasets compiled from landslide inventory by using three ML models, i.e., random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and support vector machine (SVM), are first conducted to obtain the initial landslide susceptibility indices at different space locations. Then, the landslide susceptibility indices are analyzed with the proposed sampling strategy which considers directly the grid units with very high and very low landslide susceptibility indices as potential positive and negative samples, respectively, to enrich the initial dataset; and the number of these positive/negative samples is determined by a Bayesian optimization algorithm. Thereafter, the ML models are updated with the enriched datasets. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, the improved models are applied to assess the landslide susceptibility of Taojiang County, China, and the results are compared with those from initial corresponding models without updating. The results show that compared with the initial RF, GBDT and SVM models, the corresponding improved models have a better performance in accuracy, precision, recall rate, and specificity. In particular, the AUC values of the three models are increased by 11.94%, 10.72% and 0.57%, respectively."

They directly threaten human lives and properties every year. Landslide susceptibility maps are useful tools for risk mitigation, land-use planning, and early warning systems for local areas. It is necessary to update these maps continuously because of the complexity of landslide events. This fact requires further extending the approach techniques with practical implications. Therefore, this study aimed to develop landslide susceptibility prediction maps based on advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Five state-of-art hybrid ML models were developed: Bagging – MLP, Dagging – MLP, Decorate – MLP, Rotation Forest – MLP, Random SubSpace – MLP with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a base classifier. Sixteen causative factors were collected to build landslide susceptibility maps based on the relationship between historical landslide locations and specific local geo-environmental conditions. The model performance was verified using various statistical indexes. Based on the Area Under ROC curve (AUC) analysis results of the testing dataset, the Rotation Forest – MLP model has the greatest predictive accuracy of AUC = 0.818. It is followed by the Decorate – MLP and Bagging – MLP (AUC=0.804), the Random SubSpace – MLP model (AUC=0.796), the Dagging – MLP (AUC=0.789), and the single MLP (AUC=0.698).

However, it is of primary importance to implement automated solutions aimed at performing integrated analysis of large amounts of interferometric data. To effectively detect high-displacement areas and classify ground motion sources, here we explore the feasibility of a machine learning-based approach. This is achieved by applying the random forest (RF) technique to large-scale deformation maps spanning 2015–2018. Focusing on the northern part of Italy, we train the model to identify landslide, subsidence, and mining-related ground motion with which to construct a balanced training dataset. The presence of noisy signals and other sources of deformation is also tackled within the model construction. The proposed approach relies on the use of explanatory variables extracted from the A-DInSAR datasets and from freely accessible informative layers such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land cover maps, and geohazard inventories. In general, the model performance is very promising as we achieved an overall accuracy of 0.97, a true positive rate of 0.94 and an F1-Score of 0.93. The obtained outcomes demonstrate that such transferable and automated approach may constitute an asset for stakeholders in the framework of geohazards risk management."

Therefore, the appropriate creation of risk maps is critical for mitigating shallow landslide disasters. The first task to be done was to evaluate the vulnerability of shallow landslides based on a machine learning model (random forest (RF), a support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (Log)), and a physical model (SINMAP) in the loess tableland area. By comparing the differences, the best method for evaluating the vulnerability of shallow landslide was selected. The nonlinear response relationship between shallow landslides and environmental factors was quantified based on the frequency ratio. Multicollinearity analysis was used to identify 10 factors that were applied on ML to construct the spatial distribution model. The SINMAP model used a DEM and soil physical parameters to determine the stability coefficient of the study area. The results showed that (1) shallow landslides in Dongzhiyuan mainly occurred on shady slopes with an elevation of 1068–1249 m, a slope gradient of 36°–60° and a concave shape. The stream power and stream transport indexes increased with increasing rainfall erosion, making shallow landslides likely. The susceptibility of shallow landslides changed parabolically with the change in the NDVI and mainly occurred in grassland and shrubland. (2) The four methods performed similarly in predicting the sensitivity of shallow landslides. The high-incidence areas were on both sides of eroded gully slopes. The tableland and gully bottom areas were not prone to shallow landslides. (3) The highest area under the curve (AUC) values were generated from the RF training and validation datasets of 0.92 and 0.93, respectively, followed by SVM AUC values of 0.91 and 0.92, respectively; Log AUC values of 0.91 and 0.89, respectively, and the SINMAP model AUC values of 0.69 and 0.74, respectively.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were used to verify the reliability of the results. Additionally, five common machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), are used to conduct experiments on four sampling resolutions (10 m,30 m,50 m and 70 m) to further investigate the effect of sampling resolution on LSM results. These are evaluated using a comprehensive quantitative method. The results reveal that increasing spatial resolution improves the prediction accuracy, while increasing sampling resolution produces a contrary effect. Furthermore, the impact of spatial resolution on LSM results is more pronounced than that of sampling resolution. Finally, Fanjiaping landslide and Huangtupo landslide are selected as references for comparative analysis, with the results aligning with engineering reality."

With the offshore being important for current and future energy production, there is a need to anticipate where future landslide events are likely to occur to support planning and development projects. Using the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) as a case study, this paper performs Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM) using a gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model to characterize the spatial patterns of submarine landslide probability over the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) where water depths are greater than 120 m. With known spatial extents of historic submarine landslides and a Geographic Information System (GIS) database of known topographical, geomorphological, geological, and geochemical factors, the resulting model was capable of accurately forecasting potential locations of sediment instability. Results of a permutation modelling approach indicated that LSM accuracy is sensitive to the number of unique training locations with model accuracy becoming more stable as the number of training regions was increased. The influence that each input feature had on predicting landslide susceptibility was evaluated using the SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature attribution method. Areas of high and very high susceptibility were associated with steep terrain including salt basins and escarpments. This case study serves as an initial assessment of the machine learning (ML) capabilities for producing accurate submarine landslide susceptibility maps given the current state of available natural hazard-related datasets and conveys both successes and limitations."

To minimize the impact of landslides, the need of landslide susceptibility map is important. The study aims to extract high-quality non-landslide samples and improve the accuracy of landslide susceptibility modelling (LSM) outcomes by applying a coupled method of ensemble learning and Machine Learning (ML). The Zigui-Badong section of the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA) in China was considered in the present study. Twelve influencing factors were selected as inputs for LSM, and the relationship between each causal factor and landslide spatial development was quantitatively analyzed. A total of 179 landslides have been used in the present study. About 70% of the landslide pixels were randomly considered for training, and the remaining 30% were used for validation. Logistic Regression (LR) model was applied to produce an initial susceptibility map, and the non-landslide samples were selected within the classified low-susceptibility zone. Subsequently, two ML classifiers – the Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and four coupling models – the CART-Bagging, CART-Boosting, MLP-Bagging, and MLP-Boosting, were utilized for LSM. Finally, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and statistical analysis were applied for accuracy assessment. The results show that altitude and distance to rivers were the main causal factors of landslides in the study area. The LR-MLP-Boosting performed the best with an accuracy of 0.986 followed by the LR-CART-Bagging, LR-CART-Boosting, and LR-MLP-Bagging. Accuracy comparisons demonstrate that ensemble learning algorithm can notably enhance the LSM performance of ML classifiers, and the Boosting algorithm marginally outperforms the Bagging algorithm. Moreover, the LR model can effectively constrain the selection range of non-landslide samples. The non-landslide sampling method constrained by LR yields higher quality samples compared to raditional random sampling method with no constraints, which develops a more excellent LSM."

Existing LSM methods are predominantly data-driven, allowing for significantly enhanced monitoring accuracy. However, these methods often overlook the consideration of landslide mechanisms and uncertainties associated with non-landslide samples, resulting in lower model reliability. To effectively address this issue, a knowledge-guided landslide susceptibility assessment framework is proposed in this study to enhance the interpretability and monitoring accuracy of LSM. First, a landslide knowledge graph is constructed to model the relationships between landslide entities and summarize landslide susceptibility rules. Next, combining the obtained landslide rules with geographic similarity principles, high-confidence non-landslide samples are selected to optimize the quality of the samples. Subsequently, a Landslide Knowledge Fusion Cell (LKF-Cell) is utilized to couple landslide data with landslide knowledge, resulting in the acquisition of informative and semantically rich landslide event features. Finally, a precise and credible landslide susceptibility assessment model is built based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), and landslide susceptibility spatial distribution levels are mapped. The research findings indicate that the CNN-based model outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms in predicting landslide probability; in particular, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the model was improved by 3–6% after sample optimization, and the AUC value of the LKF-Cell method was 6–11% higher than the baseline method."

Data gathered from Rain Gauges (RGs), sensors devoted to measuring the intensity of the rain at individual points, are commonly used to feed interpolation methods (e.g., the Kriging geostatistical approach) and estimate the precipitation field over an area of interest. However, the information provided by RGs could be insufficient to model complex phenomena, and computationally expensive interpolation methods could not be used in real-time environments. Integrating additional data sources (e.g., radar and geostationary satellites) is an effective solution for improving the quality of the estimate, but it needs to cope with Big Data issues. To overcome all these issues, we propose a Rainfall Estimation Model (REM) based on an Ensemble of Deep Neural Networks (DeepEns-REM) that can automatically fuse heterogeneous data sources. The usage of Residual Blocks in the base models and the adoption of a Snapshot procedure to build the ensemble guarantees a fast convergence and scalability. Experimental results, conducted on a real dataset concerning a southern region in Italy, demonstrate the quality of the proposal in comparison with the Kriging interpolation technique and other machine learning techniques, especially in the case of exceptional rainfall events."

Regular monitoring, accurate prediction, and timely alerting of people about soil movements on hills susceptible to landslides are essential due to the potential destruction to life and property. A more recent strategy for predicting soil movement is the use of machine learning (ML) models. Different univariate and multivariate ML models have been proposed in the literature. However, evaluating these univariate and multivariate approaches in predicting real-world landslides have received less attention. This paper's primary goal is to develop and compare the ability of univariate and multivariate ML models (Autoregression (AR), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Sequential Minimal Optimization regression (SMOreg), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Long-short Term Memory (LSTM)) to predict movements at a real-world landslide. The case study used for the analysis in this paper is the Tangni landslide in India. This study makes use of weekly averaged soil movement data collected from June 2012 to December 2013 (78 weeks) at the Tangni landslide site. The dataset comprises measurements from five sensors. To calibrate the parameters in each model, we divided the collected data into a training dataset (first 62 weeks) and a test dataset (last 16 weeks). Performance analysis of the models utilized Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R-squared values. The training results revealed that the univariate AR model demonstrated the best performance, achieving an RMSE of 0.149 degrees and an R-squared value of 0.572. The univariate SMOreg model obtained the second-best performance with an RMSE of 0.336 degrees and an R-squared value of 0.582. However, on the test dataset, the multivariate SARIMAX model outperformed the other models, achieving an RMSE of 0.351 degrees and an R-squared value of 0.769. The univariate SARIMA model also performed well with an RMSE of 0.356 degrees and an R-squared value of 0.741. The findings of this study can have significant implications in the field of landslide prediction and prevention. The results indicate that the multivariate SARIMAX model, the most accurate in predicting soil movements, can aid in developing early warning systems against landslides in hilly areas."

The prediction of this phenomenon is of great interest; however, it is a complex task in which traditional methods have limitations. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a successful alternative in the geological field. Most of the related works use classical machine learning algorithms to correlate the variables of the phenomenon and its occurrence. This requires large quantitative landslide datasets, collected and labeled manually, which is costly in terms of time and effort. In this work, we create an image dataset using an official landslide inventory, which we verified and updated based on journalistic information and interpretation of satellite images of the study area. The images cover the landslide crowns and the actual triggering values of the conditioning factors at the detail level (5 × 5 pixels). Our approach focuses on the specific location where the landslide starts and its proximity, unlike other works that consider the entire landslide area as the occurrence of the phenomenon. These images correspond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and anthropological variables, which are stacked in a similar way to the channels of a conventional image to feed and train a convolutional neural network. Therefore, we improve the quality of the data and the representation of the phenomenon to obtain a more robust, reliable and accurate prediction model. The results indicate an average accuracy of 97.48%, which allows the generation of a landslide susceptibility map on the Aloag-Santo Domingo highway in Ecuador.

In South Korea, the current landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) approach is mainly based on statistical techniques (logistic regression (LR) analysis). According to previous studies, this method has achieved an accuracy of approximately 75.2%. In this paper, we expand upon this traditional approach by comparing the performance of six machine learning (ML) algorithms for LSM in Inje County, South Korea. The study employed a combination of geographical data gathered from 2005 to 2019 to train and evaluate six algorithms, including LR, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The effectiveness of these models was measured by various criteria, such as the percentage of correct classification (PCC) score, F1 score, and Kappa score. The results demonstrated that the PCC and F 1 scores of the six models fell between [0.869–0.941] and [0.857–0.940], respectively. RF and XGB had the highest PCC and F 1 scores of 0.939 and 0.941, respectively. This study indicates that ML can be a valuable technique for high-resolution LSM in South Korea instead of the current approach."
Unsupervised active–transfer learning for automated landslide mapping,"Zhihao Wang, Alexander Brenning",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2023.105457,https://openalex.org/W4387004893,"Detailed landslide inventories are required for multiple purposes including disaster damage assessments, susceptibility mapping for spatial planning, and disaster risk reduction. Active learning is an artificial intelligence strategy that can achieve good performances in landslide mapping by training a machine-learning model with a reduced number of landslide/non-landslide observations, which can save time and effort in labeling training instances. Nevertheless, active-learning models are unstable at the beginning of sample selection due to the limited initial knowledge of landslide distribution. Transfer learning can help make the learner robust by transferring a landslide model trained on an existing landslide inventory from a different, but geographically similar source area, to the unseen target area. In order to adjust a transferred machine-learning model to the possibly unique environmental characteristics of the unseen area, we proposed a new framework called Unsupervised Active-Transfer Learning (UATL). This framework used a weight function to combine the landslide model transferred from the source area, with a model trained on a small, but increasing number of landslide/non-landslide observations from the target area to efficiently build a more robust learner. We examined two methods, adaptive UATL and regular UATL, which differed in the way they assign weights to the combined learners. We evaluated our proposed new methods by comparing them with three benchmark methods (active learning only, model transfer only, and the model trained in the unseen area itself) by means of the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC) as the evaluation criterion. The results showed that the new methods, and especially adaptive UATL, can achieve good predictive performances. With only about 235 training instances from the target area, the partial AUROC obtained from adaptive UATL was only 2% lower than that obtained from the model trained in the target area itself, and consistently outperformed the other two benchmarks. Overall, we suggest that the framework proposed can be applied to the natural hazards management workflow for assisting in emergency response, especially in data-scarce regions (e.g., mountainous areas and developing countries)."
A GIS based landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning and alternative forest road routes assessment in protection forests,Ender Buğday,2022,https://doi.org/10.31298/sl.146.3-4.4,https://openalex.org/W4225407210,"Forestry activities should be carried out within the purview of sustainable forestry while reaping the benefits of forestry. Accordingly, the construction of forest roads through forests should be carefully planned, especially in protection forests. Forest areas in Turkey are generally widespread in mountainous and high sloping areas that are susceptible to landslides-landslide susceptibility is one of the most important criteria for the selection of protected forests. As such, it is important to evaluate detailed and applicable alternatives regarding special areas and private forests. The aim of this study is to determine alternative routes for forest roads in protected forests through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), particularly in areas with high landslide susceptibility. To this end, a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) was created using logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) modeling methods, which are widely used in machine learning (ML). Two models with the highest receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) values were selected, and ten factors (slope, elevation, lithology, distance to road, distance to fault, distance to river, curvature, stream power index, topographic position index, and topographic wetness index) were used. The best LSM modeling method was AUC. The AUC value was 90.6% with the RF approach and 80.3% with the LR approach. The generated LSMs were used to determine alternative routes that were calculated through cost path analysis. It is hoped that the susceptibility to landslides and selection of alternative forest road routes determined through the approaches and techniques in this study will benefit forest road planning as well as plan and decision makers."

The results are found to be promising, with the achieved ROC AUC up to 91.5% based on the testing data. The resolution of the susceptibility map is enhanced by approximately three orders of magnitude further than the introduction of additional features critically selected with feature engineering and based on domain knowledge and past experiences."

In recent years, a lot of research on LSP has focused on machine learning algorithms, and the ensemble learning algorithm is a new direction to build the optimal prediction. Logistic model tree (LMT) combines the advantages of decision tree and logistic regression, which is smaller and more robust than ordinary algorithms. The main aim of this study is to construct and test LMT-based random forest (RF) and selected ensemble learning algorithms including bagging and boosting algorithms to compare their performance. Firstly, taking the county of Ziyang, China, as the study area, through historical reports, aerial-photo interpretations, and field investigations, 690 inventory maps of landslide locations were constructed and randomly divided into the 70/30 ratio for a training and validation dataset. Secondly, considering geological conditions, and landslide-induced disease and its characteristics, 14 landslide-conditioning factors was selected. Thirdly, the variance-inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance (TOL) were used to analyze the 14 factors, and the prediction ability was calculated with information-gain technology. Ultimately, the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to verify and compare model performance. Results showed that the LMT-RF model (0.897) was superior to other models, and the performance of LMT single model (0.791) was the worst. Therefore, it can be inferred that the LMT-RF model is a promising model, and the outcome of this study will be useful to planners and scientists in landslide sensitivity studies in similar situations."

Analysis of GIS data varies widely and may include some modeling and predictions which are usually computing-intensive and complicated, especially, when large datasets are involved. With advancement in computing technologies, techniques such as Machine learning (ML) are being suggested as a potential game changer in the analysis of GIS data because of their comparative speed, accuracy, automation, and repeatability. Perhaps, the greatest benefit of using both GIS and ML is the ability to transfer results from one database to another. GIS and ML tools have been used extensively in medicine, urban development, and environmental modeling such as landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP). There is also the problem of data loss during conversion between GIS systems in medicine, while in geotechnical areas such as erosion and flood prediction, lack of data and variability in soil has limited the use of GIS and ML techniques. This paper gives an overview of the current ML methods that have been incorporated into the spatial analysis of data obtained from GIS tools for LSP, health, and urban development. The use of Supervised Machine Learning (SML) algorithms such as decision trees, SVM, KNN, and perceptron including Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms such as k-means, elbow algorithms, and hierarchal algorithm have been discussed.

Intelligent Control of Groundwater in Slopes with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Aynaz Biniyaz, Behnam Azmoon, Zhen Liu",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22218503,https://openalex.org/W4308719630,"The occurrence of landslides has been increasing in recent years due to intense and prolonged rainfall events. Lowering the groundwater in natural and man-made slopes can help to mitigate the hazards. Subsurface drainage systems equipped with pumps have traditionally been regarded as a temporary remedy for lowering the groundwater in geosystems, whereas long-term usage of pumping-based techniques is uncommon due to the associated high operational costs in labor and energy. This study investigates the intelligent control of groundwater in slopes enabled by deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a subfield of machine learning for automated decision-making. The purpose is to develop an autonomous geosystem that can minimize the operating cost and enhance the system's safety without introducing human errors and interventions. To prove the concept, a seepage analysis model was implemented using a partial differential equation solver, FEniCS, to simulate the geosystem (i.e., a slope equipped with a pump and subjected to rainfall events). A Deep Q-Network (i.e., a DRL learning agent) was trained to learn the optimal control policy for regulating the pump's flow rate. The objective is to enable intermittent control of the pump's flow rate (i.e., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the pumping capacity) to keep the groundwater close to the target level during rainfall events and consequently help to prevent slope failure. A comparison of the results with traditional proportional-integral-derivative-controlled and uncontrolled water tables showed that the geosystem integrated with DRL can dynamically adapt its response to diverse weather events by adjusting the pump's flow rate and improve the adopted control policy by gaining more experience over time. In addition, it was observed that the DRL control helped to mitigate slope failure during rainfall events."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction: Improving the Quality of Landslide Samples by Isolation Forests,"Qinghua Zhang, Zhu Liang, Wei Liu, Weiping Peng, Houzan Huang, Shouwen Zhang, Lingwei Chen, Kaihua Jiang, Lixing Liu",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/su142416692,https://openalex.org/W4311364093,"Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) is the first step to ease landslide disasters with the application of various machine learning methods. A complete landslide inventory, which is essential but difficult to obtain, should include high-quality landslide and non-landslide samples. The insufficient number of landslide samples and the low purity of non-landslide samples limit the performance of the machine learning models. In response, this study aims to explore the effectiveness of isolated forest (IF) to solve the problem of insufficient landslide samples. IF belongs to unsupervised learning, and only a small share of landslide samples in the study area were required for modeling, while the remaining samples were used for testing. Its performance was compared to another advanced integration model, adaptive boosting integrated with decision tree (Ada-DT), which belongs to two-class classifiers (TCC) and needs a sufficient number of samples. Huangpu District, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province in China, was selected as the study area, and 13 predisposing factors were prepared for the modeling. Results showed that the IF proved its effectiveness with an AUC value of 0.875, although the Ada-DT model performed better (AUC = 0.921). IF outperformed the Ada-DT model in terms of recognizing landslides, and the sensitivity values of IF and the Ada-DT model were 90.00% and 86.67%, respectively, while the Ada-DT model performed better in terms of specificity. Two susceptibility maps obtained by the models were basically consistent with the field investigation, while the areas predicted by IF tended to be conservative as higher risk areas were presented, and the Ada-DT model was likely to be risky. It is suggested to select non-landslide samples from the very low susceptibility areas predicted by the IF model to form a more reliable sample set for Ada-DT modeling. The conclusion confirms the practicality and advancement of the idea of anomaly detection in LSP and improves the application potential of machine learning algorithms for geohazards."

In the present study, we have comparatively analyzed landslide susceptibility by employing integrated geospatial approaches, i.e., data-driven, knowledge-driven, and machine learning (ML), along the main road corridors of the Muzaffarabad district. The landslide inventory of three road corridors is developed to evaluate landslide susceptibility, and eleven landslide causative factors (LCFs) were analyzed. After statistical significance analysis, these eleven LCFs generated susceptibility models using WoE, AHP, LR, and RF. Distance from roads, landcover, lithological units, and slopes are considered more influential LCFs. The performance matrix of different LSMs is evaluated through the area under the curve (AUC-ROC), overall accuracy, Kappa index, F 1 score, Mean Absolute Error, and Root Mean Square Error. The AUC-ROC for WoE, AHP, LR, and RF techniques along Neelum road is 0.86, 0.82, 0.91, and 0.97, respectively, along Jhelum Valley road is 0.83, 0.81, 0.93, and 0.95, respectively, while along Kohala road is 0.89, 0.88, 0.89, and 0.92, respectively. The produced LSMs through ML (i.e., RF and LR) showed better prediction accuracies than WoE and AHP along these three road corridors. The LSMs are categorized into very high, high, moderate, and low susceptible zones along these roads. The LSM generated through hybrid models can facilitate the concerned local agencies to implement landslide mitigation policies for the landslide-prone zones along road corridors."

Evaluating Variations in Tropical Cyclone Precipitation in Eastern Mexico Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Laiyin Zhu, Pascual Aguilera",2021,https://doi.org/10.1029/2021jd034604,https://openalex.org/W3121620620,"Abstract Tropical Cyclone Precipitation (TCP) is one of the major triggers of flash flooding and landslide in eastern Mexico. We apply different statistical and machine learning techniques to study a 99 years TCP climatology in high resolution. Strong correlations exist between location variables and annual mean TCP, as well as between dynamic variables and event TCP. Topographic variables observe mixed signals with the elevation variances positively correlated with TCP. The Random Forest (RF) model is a powerful tool with excellent fitting and predicting skills for TCP variations. It has a very small out‐of‐sample cross‐validation error and well captures the spatial variations of historical TCP events. Only three location variables are needed to construct the best model for the annual mean TCP while the best model needs 18 variables to explain the complex variations in the event TCP. The distance to the track is the most important variable for the event TCP model and many other factors contribute to the TCP collectively and nonlinearly, which can't be captured fully by the previous correlation analysis. They include translation characteristics of the storms, locations of the precipitation grid, and topography. Event TCP is generally larger in storms with slower translation speed and more variance in their tracks. While the lower coastal area generally has a higher probability of TCP, the higher inland has elevation variances that enhance less frequent but extreme TCP events. The RF algorithm is an efficient machine learning approach showing potentials for future Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF)."

This parameter can be measured in field or estimated through physically-based models, limited by the availability of effective input soil properties and preliminary calibrations. Data-driven models, based on machine learning techniques, could overcome these gaps. The aim of this paper is then to develop an innovative machine learning methodology to assess soil water potential trends and to implement them in models to predict shallow landslides. Monitoring data since 2012 from test-sites slopes in Oltrepò Pavese (northern Italy) were used to build the models. Within the tested techniques, Random Forest models allowed an outstanding reconstruction of measured soil water potential temporal trends. Each model is sensitive to meteorological and hydrological characteristics according to soil depths and features. Reliability of the proposed models was confirmed by correct estimation of days when shallow landslides were triggered in the study areas in December 2020, after implementing the modeled trends on a slope stability model, and by the correct choice of physically-based rainfall thresholds. These results confirm the potential application of the developed methodology to estimate hydrological scenarios that could be used for decision-making purposes."

Usually, shallow landslides are triggered by prolonged or severe rainfalls and frequently may evolve into potentially catastrophic flow-like movements. Shallow failures are typical in hilly and mountainous areas due to the combination of several predisposing factors such as slope morphology, geological and structural setting, mechanical properties of soils, hydrological and hydrogeological conditions, land-use changes and wildfires. Because of the ability of these phenomena to travel long distances, buildings and infrastructures located in areas improperly deemed safe can be affected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Spatial and temporal hazard posed by flow-like movements is due to both source characteristics (e.g., location and volume) and the successive runout dynamics (e.g., travelled paths and distances). Hence, the assessment of shallow landslide susceptibility has to take into account not only the recognition of the most probable landslide source areas, but also &amp;amp;#160;landslide runout (i.e., travel distance). In recent years, a meaningful improvement in landslide detachment susceptibility evaluation has been gained through robust scientific advances, especially by using statistical approaches. Furthermore, various techniques are available for landslide runout susceptibility assessment in quantitative terms. The combination of landslide detachment and runout dynamics has been admitted by many researchers as a suitable and complete procedure for landslide susceptibility evaluation. However, despite its significance, runout assessment is not as widespread in literature as landslide detachment assessment and still remains a challenge for researchers. Currently, only a few studies focus on the assement of both landslide detachment susceptibility (LDS) and landslide runout susceptibility (LRS).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout.

This methodology has been applied to the Cinque Terre National Park (Liguria, north-west Italy), where risk posed by flow-like movements is very high. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. In particular, the obtained map may be useful for urban and regional planning, as well as for decision-makers and stakeholders, to predict areas that may be affected by rainfall-induced shallow landslides&amp;amp;#160; in the future and to identify areas where risk mitigation measures are needed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;"

Landslide is a frequently observed natural phenomenon and a geohazard with destructive effects on economies, society and the environment. Production of up-to-date landslide susceptibility (LS) maps is an essential process for landslide hazard mitigation.

The produced geospatial datasets can be integrated in data-driven methods for obtaining accurate LS maps. In the present study, LS map was produced by using data-driven machine learning (ML) methods, i.e. random forest (RF). An earthquake and landslide prone area from the south-eastern part of Turkey was selected as the study area. Topographical derivatives were extracted from digital surface models (DSMs) produced by using aerial photogrammetric datasets with 30 cm ground sampling distances. The lithological parameters were employed in the study together with an accurate landslide inventory, which were also delineated by using the high-resolution DSMs and orthophotos. The relationships between the landslide occurrence and the pre-defined conditioning factors were analyzed using the frequency ratio (FR) method. The results show that the RF method exhibits high prediction performance in the study area with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.92."

Landslide is one of the most common natural disasters triggered mainly due to heavy rainfall, cloud burst, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, unorganized constructions of roads, and deforestation. In India, field surveying is the most common method used to identify potential landslide regions and update the landslide inventories maintained by the Geological Survey of India, but it is very time-consuming, costly, and inefficient. Alternatively, advanced remote sensing technologies in landslide analysis allow rapid and easy data acquisitions and help to improve the traditional method of landslide detection capabilities. Supervised Machine learning algorithms, for example, Support Vector Machine (SVM), are challenging to conventional techniques by predicting disasters with astounding accuracy. In this research work, we have utilized open-source datasets (Landsat 8 multi-band images and JAXA ALOS DSM) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to identify landslides in Rudraprayag using machine learning techniques. Rudraprayag is a district of Uttarakhand state in India, which has always been the center of attention of geological studies due to its higher density of landslide-prone zones. For the training and validation purpose, labeled landslide locations obtained from landslide inventory (prepared by the Geological Survey of India) and layers such as NDVI, NDWI, and slope (generated from JAXA ALOS DSM and Landsat 8 satellite multi-band imagery) were used.

Area under the ROC curve (AUC), true skill statistics (TSS), correlation coefficient (COR), normalized mutual information (NMI), and correct classification rate (CCR) were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the proposed model. The results show that the resampling algorithm improves the performance of the standalone model. Results also revealed that standalone models had better performance with the CV algorithm compared to the Bt and RS algorithms. The Bt-RF model excels in statistical measures (AUC = 0.97, TSS = 0.97, COR = 0.99, NMI = 0.50, and CCR = 0.93). Given the admirable performance of the proposed models in a moderate scale area, promising results can be expected from these models for other regions."
Landslide Mapping and Causes of Landslides in the China–Nepal Transportation Corridor Based on Remote Sensing Technology,"Shufen Zhao, Runqiang Zeng, Zhang Zong-lin, Xingmin Meng, Tianjun Qi, Long Zhao, Weiwei Guo, Guojun Si",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16020356,https://openalex.org/W4390910047,"The China–Nepal Transportation Corridor is vital to the country’s efforts to build a land trade route in South Asia and promote the Ring-Himalayan Economic Cooperation Belt. Due to the complex geological structure and topographical environment of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, coupled with the impact of climate change, the frequent occurrence of geological disasters has increased the operational difficulty of the China–Nepal Highway and the construction difficulty of the China–Nepal Railway. However, to date, there has been no systematic study of the spatial distribution of landslides along the entire route within the area, the factors influencing landslides at different scales, or the causes of landslides under different topographic backgrounds. There is an even greater lack of research on areas threatened by potential landslides. This study comprehensively applies remote sensing, mathematical statistics, and machine learning methods to map landslides along the China–Nepal transportation corridor, explore the influencing factors and causes of different types of landslides, and investigate the distribution characteristics of potential landslides. A total of 609 historic landslides have been interpreted in the study area and were found to be distributed along faults and locally concentrated. The strata from which landslides develop are relatively weak and are mainly distributed within 2 km of a fault with a slope between 20° and 30°. The direction of slope for the majority of landslides is south to south-west, and their elevation is between 4000 and 5000 m. In addition, we discovered a power law relationship between landslide area and volume (VL = 2.722 × AL1.134) and determined that there were 47 super-large landslides, 213 large landslides, and 349 small and medium-sized landslides in the area, respectively. Slope is the most significant influencing factor for the development of landslides in the area. Apart from slope, faults and strata significantly influence the development of large and medium-small landslides, respectively. We have identified 223 potential landslides in the region, 15 of which directly threaten major transport routes, mainly in the Renbu Gorge section of the China–Nepal Highway and the proposed China–Nepal Railway section from Peikucuo to Gyirong County. In addition, we also discussed the causes of landslides within three geomorphic units in the region. First, the combined effects of faulting, elevation, and relatively weak strata contribute to the development of super-large and large landslides in the Gyirong basin and gorge. Second, the relatively weak strata and the cumulative damaging effects of earthquakes promote the development of small and medium-sized landslides in the Xainza-Dinggye rift basin. Third, under the combined effect of the hanging wall effect of thrust faults and the relatively weak material composition, landslides of various types have developed in the Nagarzê mountain. It is worth noting that potential landslides have developed in all three geomorphic units mentioned above. This study provides data and theory to assist in the accurate mitigation and control of landslide hazards in the corridor."

The selection of earthquake-related factors is pivotal for seismic LSA. In this study, Newmark displacement (Dn) is employed as the earthquake-related factor, providing a detailed representation of seismic characteristics. On the algorithmic side, a dual-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) model is built, and the last classification layer is replaced with two machine learning (ML) models to facilitate the extraction of deeper features related to landslide development. This research focuses on Beichuan County in Sichuan Province, China. Fifteen landslide predisposing factors, including hydrological, geomorphic, geological, vegetation cover, anthropogenic, and earthquake-related features, were extensively collected. The results demonstrate some specific issues. Dn outperforms conventional earthquake-related factors such as peak ground acceleration (PGA) and Arias intensity (Ia) in capturing seismic influence on landslide development. Under the same conditions, the OA improved by 5.55% and AUC improved by 0.055 compared to the PGA; the OA improved by 3.2% and AUC improved by 0.0327 compared to the Ia. The improved CNN outperforms ML models. Under the same conditions, the OA improved by 4.69% and AUC improved by 0.0467 compared to RF; the OA improved by 4.47% and AUC improved by 0.0447 compared to SVM. Additionally, historical landslides validate the reasonableness of the landslide susceptibility maps. The proposed method exhibits a high rate of overlap with the historical landslide inventory. The proportion of historical landslides in the very high and high susceptibility zones exceeds 87%. The method not only enhances accuracy but also produces a more fine-grained susceptibility map, providing a reliable basis for early warning of seismic landslides."

The DvD algorithm outperformed the BSS-UNET framework and achieved 0.80 mIoU when applied to the IARAI dataset. The proposed empirical method has the potential to serve as large-scale rapid landslide inventory preparation subject to the availability of cloud-free satellite imagery."

In this study, different conditioning factors, e.g., topographical, geomorphological, climatic, and geological factors were considered. Two machine learning approaches, i.e., logistic regression and artificial neural network were used to develop landslide susceptibility maps. The accuracy test was carried out using the receiving operative characteristic (ROC) curve. Which showed that the success and prediction rates of LR model is 82.60 and 81.60%, while 77.90 and 75.40%, for the ANN model. Due to the physiographic condition of the area, the rainfall density was considered as the primary triggering factor and landslide index map was generated. Moreover, using the Aster data the land cover (LC) map was developed. The settlements were extracted from the LC map and used as the elements at risk and hence, the vulnerability index was developed. Finally, the landslide risk map (LRM) for the Hunza–Nagar valley was developed. The LRM indicated that 37.25 (20.21 km 2 ) and 47.64% (25.84 km 2 ) of the total settlements lie in low and very high-risk zones. This landslide risk map can help decision-makers for potential land development and landslide countermeasures."

Landslides are influenced by many factors, such as geology, topography, natural drainage, land cover, rainfall and earthquakes, although the underlying mechanism is too complex and very difficult to explain in detail. In this study, the susceptibility mapping of co-seismic landslides is carried out using a machine learning approach, considering six districts covering an area of 12,887 km 2 in Nepal. Landslide inventory map is prepared by taking 23,164 post seismic landslide data points that occurred after the 7.8 MW 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Twelve causative factors, including distance from the rupture plane, peak ground acceleration and distance from the fault, are considered input parameters. The overall accuracy of the model is 87.2%, the area under the ROC curve is 0.94, the Kappa coefficient is 0.744 and the RMSE value is 0.358, which indicates that the performance of the model is excellent with the causative factors considered. The susceptibility thus developed shows that Sindhupalchowk district has the largest percentage of area under high and very high susceptibility classes, and the most susceptible local unit in Sindhupalchowk is the Barhabise municipality, with 19.98% and 20.34% of its area under high and very high susceptibility classes, respectively. For the analysis of building exposure to co-seismic landslide susceptibility, a building footprint map is developed and overlaid on the co-seismic landslide susceptibility map. The results show that the Sindhupalchowk and Dhading districts have the largest and smallest number of houses exposed to co-seismic landslide susceptibility. Additionally, when conducting a risk analysis based on susceptibility mapping, as well as considering socio-economic and structural vulnerability in Barhabise municipality, revealed that only 106 (1.1%) of the total 9591 households, were found to be at high risk. As this is the first study of co-seismic landslide risk study carried out in Nepal and covers a regional to the municipal level, this can be a reference for future studies in Nepal and other parts of the world and can be helpful in planning development activities for government bodies."

This study employs potential machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to assess landslide susceptibility in Van Yen District, Yen Bai Province, Vietnam, that experiences a higher frequency of landslides compared to other localities in the region. The study incorporates thirteen input variables, including elevation, slope angle, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), distance to faults, lithology, distance to roads, distance to rivers, land cover, rainfall, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). To construct the models, landslide statistics reports were utilized, consisting of 302 landslide points collected through field surveys and 52 landslide points determined using Radar Sentinel-1 images. The Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform is utilized for constructing the landslide susceptibility models. The outcome of the research is a landslide susceptibility map with five levels: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of all three models. The findings indicate that, besides similarities observed in landslide susceptibility maps for previously occurred landslides, the Random Forest model demonstrates a favorable performance compared to the other models, with an AUC of 0.883."

In this regard, 200 landslide events were inventoried from historical data, aerial images and conducted fieldworks. Sixteen triggering factors were selected according to the literature and geographical features (Monsoon period). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) outcomes revealed that the RF achieved better performance with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.96, pursued by XGBoost and SVM with AUC of 0.94 and 0.90, respectively. This assessment presents an essential understanding of the effective implementation of ML in landslide assessment in the mountainous region of the eastern Mediterranean. We emphasized, hence, that the RF algorithm has the most robust performance of landslide susceptibility prediction in the western Syria. Moreover, the outputs of this study will provide local decision-makers with insights to produce regional management strategies for the landslide, especially after the Syrian war phase."
Landslide hazard cascades can trigger earthquakes,"Zhen Zhang, Min Liu, Yen Joe Tan, Fabian Walter, Siming He, Małgorzata Chmiel, Jinrong Su",2024,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47130-w,https://openalex.org/W4394577229,"Abstract While earthquakes are well-known to trigger surface hazards and initiate hazard cascades, whether surface hazards can instead trigger earthquakes remains underexplored. In 2018, two landslides on the Tibetan plateau created landslide-dammed lakes which subsequently breached and caused catastrophic outburst floods. Here we build an earthquake catalog using machine-learning and cross-correlation-based methods which shows there was a statistically significant increase in earthquake activity (local magnitude ≤ 2.6) as the landslide-dammed lake approached peak water level which returned to the background level after dam breach. We further find that ~90% of the seismicity occurred where Coulomb stress increased due to the combined effect of direct loading and pore pressure diffusion. The close spatial and temporal correlation between the calculated Coulomb stress increase and earthquake activity suggests that the earthquakes were triggered by these landslide hazard cascades. Finally, our Coulomb stress modeling considering the properties of landslide-dammed lakes and reservoir-induced earthquakes globally suggests that earthquake triggering by landslide-dammed lakes and similar structures may be a ubiquitous phenomenon. Therefore, we propose that earthquake-surface hazard interaction can include bidirectional triggering which should be properly accounted for during geological hazard assessment and management in mountainous regions."

Hilly areas such as the state of Mizoram in India have suffered from landslides during the rainy season. This study compares twelve hybrid deep learning and machine learning models to predict daily rainfall using meteorological variables such as maximum humidity, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall. The compared models include Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-Artificial Neural Network (PSO-ANN I), PSO with stacked ANN (PSO-ANN II), PSO-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (PSO-BiLSTM), PSO-BiLSTM-ANN without Dropout Layer (PSO-BiLSTM-ANN I), PSO-BiLSTM-ANN with Dropout Layer (PSO-BiLSTM-ANN II), Stacked BiLSTM with ANN (PSO-BiLSTM-ANN III), PSO-Long Short-Term Memory (PSO-LSTM), PSO-LSTM-ANN without Dropout Layer (PSO-LSTM-ANN I), PSO-LSTM-ANN with Dropout Layer (PSO-LSTM-ANN II), Stacked LSTM with ANN (PSO-LSTM-ANN III), PSO-Recurrent Neural Network with ANN (PSO-RNN-ANN), and PSO-Support Vector Regression with Linear Kernel (PSO-SVR). We trained and tested the models using 12,418 days of meteorological data from 1985 to 2018 collected by the Aizawl Weather Station in Mizoram, India. The study used Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">2</sup> ) to evaluate the performance of the models. It is observed that the PSO-BiLSTM-ANN II model, which is a stack of BiLSTM, ANN and Dropout layer, achieved the best performance and outperformed the PSO-SVR model by 6.4%. The PSO-BiLSTM-ANN II model also requires fewer cells in the hidden layer than other models and converges with the lowest epochs. The results show the advantage of adding the ANN layer in the RNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models, and this study provides a benchmark model for predicting rainfall in the study area."
Optimization method of conditioning factors selection and combination for landslide susceptibility prediction,"Faming Huang, K Y Liu, Shui‐Hua Jiang, Filippo Catani, Weiping Liu, Xuanmei Fan, Jinsong Huang",2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2024.04.029,https://openalex.org/W4401982030,"Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) is significantly affected by the uncertainty issue of landslide related conditioning factor selection. However, most of literature only performs comparative studies on a certain conditioning factor selection method rather than systematically study this uncertainty issue. Targeted, this study aims to systematically explore the influence rules of various commonly used conditioning factor selection methods on LSP, and on this basis to innovatively propose a principle with universal application for optimal selection of conditioning factors. An'yuan County in southern China is taken as example considering 431 landslides and 29 types of conditioning factors. Five commonly used factor selection methods, namely, the correlation analysis (CA), linear regression (LR), principal component analysis (PCA), rough set (RS) and artificial neural network (ANN), are applied to select the optimal factor combinations from the original 29 conditioning factors. The factor selection results are then used as inputs of four types of common machine learning models to construct 20 types of combined models, such as CA-multilayer perceptron, CA-random forest. Additionally, multifactor-based multilayer perceptron random forest models that selecting conditioning factors based on the proposed principle of ""accurate data, rich types, clear significance, feasible operation and avoiding duplication"" are constructed for comparisons. Finally, the LSP uncertainties are evaluated by the accuracy, susceptibility index distribution, etc. Results show that: (1) multifactor-based models have generally higher LSP performance and lower uncertainties than those of factors selection-based models; (2) Influence degree of different machine learning on LSP accuracy is greater than that of different factor selection methods. Conclusively, the above commonly used conditioning factor selection methods are not ideal for improving LSP performance and may complicate the LSP processes. In contrast, a satisfied combination of conditioning factors can be constructed according to the proposed principle."

At present, the extraction of coseismic landslides is mainly based on post-earthquake site investigation or the interpretation of human–computer interactions based on remote sensing images. However, the identification efficiency is low, which seriously delays the earthquake emergency response. On the basis of the available multisource and multiscale remote sensing data, numerous studies have been carried out on the methods of coseismic landslide extraction, such as pixel analysis, object-oriented analysis, change detection, and machine learning. However, the effectiveness of coseismic landslide extraction was low in wide areas with complex topographic and geomorphic backgrounds. Therefore, this paper offers a comprehensive study of the factors influencing coseismic landslides and researches rapid and accurate wide-area coseismic landslide extraction methods with multisource remote sensing and geoscience technology. These techniques include digital elevation modeling (DEM) and its derived slopes and aspects. An embedded multichannel spectral–topographic feature fusion model for coseismic landslide extraction based on DeepLab V3+ is proposed, and a knowledge-enhanced deep learning information extraction method integrating geological knowledge is formed. Using the Jiuzhaigou Ms7.0 earthquake (seismic intensity VIII) in Sichuan Province, China, a comparison of landslide extraction models and strategies is carried out. The results show that the model proposed in this paper achieves the best balance in the accuracy and efficiency of wide-area extractions. Using multiple feature data of coseismic landslides, the problem of mixed pixels is solved. The rate of the misidentification of landslides as clouds, snow, buildings, and roads is significantly lower than in other methods. The identified landslide boundaries are smoother and more accurate, and the connectivity is better. Compared with other methods, ours can more accurately eliminate landslides not triggered by the Jiuzhaigou earthquake. While using the image block strategy to ensure extraction efficiency, it also improves the extraction accuracy of wide-area coseismic landslides in complex backgrounds."

The traditional research of landslide disaster based on experience driving or statistical model and its assessment results are subjective , difficult to quantify, and no pertinence. As a new research method for landslide susceptibility assessment, machine learning can greatly improve the landslide susceptibility model's accuracy by constructing statistical models. Taking Western Henan for example, the study selected 16 landslide influencing factors such as topography, geological environment, hydrological conditions, and human activities. And 11 landslide factors with the most significant influence on the landslide were selected by the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. There are five machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)) were used to construct the spatial distribution model of landslide susceptibility. The models were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve and statistical index. After analysis and comparison, the XGBoost model (AUC 0.8759) performed the best and was suitable for dealing with regression problems. The model had a high adaptability to landslide data. According to the landslide susceptibility map of the five models, the overall distribution can be observed. The extremely high and high susceptibility areas are distributed in the Funiu Mountain range in the southwest, the Xiaoshan Mountain range in the west, and the Yellow River basin in the north. These areas have large terrain fluctuations, complicated geological structural environments and frequent human engineering activities. The extremely high and highly prone areas were 12043.3 km<sup>2</sup> and 3087.45 km<sup>2</sup>, accounting for 47.61% and 12.20% of the total area of the study area, respectively. Our study reflects the distribution of landslide susceptibility in western Henan Province, which provides a scientific basis for regional disaster warning, prediction, and resource protection.

The high rate of forest destruction is caused by various factors, including weak law enforcement efforts against forestry crimes, such as illegal logging events. However, in Indonesia, illegal logging is only discovered when the perpetrator has distributed the wood products. The lack of monitoring of the overall condition of the forest has an impact on the current high level of forest destruction. Through this research, the problems related to environmental damage due to illegal logging will be described through remote sensing technology, which is currently mainly developed on the basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning, namely Google Earth Engine (GEE). Monitoring of illegal logging events will be analysed using Sentinel 1 and 2 data. Obtaining satellite imagery with relatively small cloud cover for tropical regions, such as Indonesia, is remarkably difficult. This difficulty is due to the presence of a radar sensor on Sentinel 1 images that can penetrate clouds, allowing for observation of the forest condition even in the presence of clouds. Using the random forest classification algorithm of the GEE platform, data on forest conditions in 2021 were obtained, covering an area of 2,843,938.87 ha or 63% of the total area of Sulawesi Selatan Province. An analysis using a map of the function of forest areas revealed that of the current forest area, 38.46% was non-forest estates and 61.54% was forest areas. The continued identification of illegal logging events also found 1971 spots of forest change events in the vulnerable time of the first period (January–April) with the second period (April–August), and 1680 spots of forest change events in the vulnerable period of the second period (April–August) with the third period (September–December), revealing a total incident area of 7599.28 ha."

An interpretable module is built based on a self-attention mechanism to reveal the importance and contribution of various influencing factors to EQIL spatial distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the ISeL model is superior to the excellent state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Furthermore, according to the interpretable module in the ISeL method, the critical controlling and triggering factors are revealed. The ISeL method can also be applied in other earthquake-frequent regions worldwide because of its good generalization and transferability."

Therefore, it is crucial to have reliable prediction models for landslide susceptibility in order to identify high-risk areas and implement proactive measures to prevent or mitigate their impacts. The purpose of this study is to propose and evaluate a novel approach called BCM-DeepNeuralNets for spatial prediction of the areas most susceptible to landslides. The study focuses on a tropical cyclone area in three districts of central Vietnam, namely Nam Tra My, Bac Tra My, and Phuoc Son. Accordingly, ten input factors were considered: slope, aspect, elevation, relief amplitude, land use, soil type, road distance, geology, fault distance, and rainfall. The proposed BCM-DeepNeuralNets method leverages the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to develop a deep-learning model capable of inferring landslide susceptibility indices. To optimize this model, the study employs the Balancing Composite Motions (BCM) optimization technique. Additionally, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used as benchmark models to confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach. To evaluate the prediction performance of the models, popular metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), accuracy (Acc), and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are employed. The results show that the BCM-DeepNeuralNets model exhibits high prediction performance, with an MSE of 0.038, Acc of 93.4%, and AUC of 0.971. This model outperforms the benchmark models, LR and SVM. Consequently, BCM-DeepNeuralNets emerges as a new tool with significant potential for landslide susceptibility mapping. The landslide susceptibility map generated by this research aids in the identification of landslide-prone areas, providing a more accurate understanding of associated risks. As a result, it can be instrumental in policy and decision-making processes, enabling the implementation of appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of landslides in the study area."

To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various machine-learning algorithms for classification tasks. We compared the performance of these algorithms in terms of accuracy and complexity, considering both &amp;quot;before&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; scenarios of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).&#x0D; Our findings revealed that reducing complexity and lowering entropy can lead to an increase in model accuracy. However, we also observed that this reduction in complexity comes at the cost of losing important complex patterns in the produced landslide susceptibility maps. By simplifying the model and reducing entropy, certain intricate relationships and uncertain patterns may be overlooked, resulting in a loss of information and potentially compromising the accuracy of the susceptibility maps. The analysis encompassed a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (EXT), XGboost, LightGBM, Catboost, Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Decision Trees (DT). Each algorithm was evaluated for its strengths and limitations, considering the tradeoff between accuracy and complexity.&#x0D; Before dimensionality reduction, the algorithms demonstrated promising results, with RF exhibiting excellent AUC/ROC scores and average accuracy. However, computational costs were noted as a potential drawback for RF, especially when dealing with large datasets. EXT showcased robust performance and good accuracy, while XGboost demonstrated its ability to handle complex relationships within large datasets, albeit requiring careful hyperparameter tuning. The efficiency and scalability of LightGBM made it a suitable choice for large datasets, although it displayed sensitivity to class imbalance. Catboost excelled in handling categorical features, but longer training times were observed for larger datasets. NB showcased simplicity and computational efficiency but assumed independence among features. KNN, known for its capability to capture local patterns and spatial relationships, was found to be sensitive to the choice of distance metric. GBM, while capturing complex relationships effectively, was prone to overfitting without proper regularization. DT, with its interpretability and ease of understanding, faced limitations in terms of overfitting and limited generalization. After dimensionality reduction, certain algorithms exhibited improvements in their AUC/ROC scores and average accuracy, including RF, EXT, XGboost, and LightGBM. However, for a few algorithms, such as NB and DT, a decrease in performance was observed. This study provides valuable insights into the performance characteristics, strengths, and limitations of various machine learning algorithms in classification tasks. Researchers and practitioners can utilize these findings to make informed decisions when selecting algorithms for their specific datasets and requirements. We also aim to identify the potential factors contributing to the high accuracy rates obtained from these ensembled algorithms and explore possible shortcomings of non-ensembled algorithms that may result in lower accuracy rates. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of these algorithms, we seek to provide valuable insights into the benefits and limitations of ensembled approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping.&#x0D; &#x0D; Our study sheds light on the challenges faced when balancing accuracy and complexity in machine learning models for landslide susceptibility mapping. It emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the level of complexity and entropy reduction in relation to the specific patterns and uncertainties present in the data. By providing insights into this tradeoff, our research aims to assist researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions regarding model complexity and entropy reduction, ultimately improving the quality and interpretability of landslide susceptibility maps."
Comparison between Machine Learning and Physical Models Applied to the Evaluation of Co-Seismic Landslide Hazard,"José Carlos Román-Herrera, Martín Jesús Rodríguez-Peces, Julio Garzón-Roca",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/app13148285,https://openalex.org/W4384825512,"A comparative methodology between advanced statistical tools and physical-based methods is carried out to ensure their reliability and objectivity for the evaluation of co-seismic landslide hazard maps. To do this, an inventory of landslides induced by the 2011 Lorca earthquake is used to highlight the usefulness of these methods to improve earthquake-induced landslide hazard analyses. Various statistical models, such as logistic regression, random forest, artificial neural network, and support vector machine, have been employed for co-seismic landslide susceptibility mapping. The results demonstrate that machine learning techniques using principal components (especially, artificial neural network and support vector machine) yield better results compared to other models. In particular, random forest shows poor results. Artificial neural network and support vector machine approaches are compared to the results of physical-based methods in the same area, suggesting that machine learning methods can provide better results for developing co-seismic landslide susceptibility maps. The application of different advanced statistical models shows the need for validation with an actual inventory of co-seismic landslides to ensure reliability and objectivity. In addition, statistical methods require a great amount of data. The results establish effective land planning and hazard management strategies in seismic areas to minimize the damage of future co-seismic landslides."

A novel QLattice‐based whitening machine learning model of landslide susceptibility mapping,"Deliang Sun, Yuekai Ding, Haijia Wen, Fengtai Zhang",2023,https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.5675,https://openalex.org/W4385633104,"Abstract Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) enables the prediction of landslide occurrences, thereby offering a scientific foundation for disaster prevention and control. In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on LSM using machine learning techniques. However, the majority of machine learning models is considered “black box” models due to their lack of transparent explanations. In contrast, the QLattice model serves as a white box model, as it can elucidate the decision‐making mechanism while representing a novel approach to whitening machine learning models. QLattice possesses the capability to automatically select and scale data features. In this study, Fengjie County in China was selected as the research area, with slope units serving as evaluation units. A geospatial database was constructed using 12 conditioning factors, including elevation, slope, and annual average rainfall. LSM models were conducted using both the QLattice and random forest (RF) algorithms. The findings demonstrate that the QLattice model achieved an area under curve value of 0.868, while the RF model attained an area under curve value of 0.849 for the test datasets. These results highlight the superior predictive ability and stability of the QLattice model compared with RF. Furthermore, QLattice can explicate and clarify the change processes of conditioning factors, thereby revealing the internal decision‐making mechanism and causes behind the LSM model's decisions. The innovative QLattice‐based model provides new ideas and methodologies for LSM research."

On July 22, 2013, the Min-Zhang earthquake occurred and a large number of casualties and building burying were caused by the geological disasters induced by seismic motion. The present research aims to generate seismic landslides susceptibility prediction maps of Min-Zhang earthquake using different machine learning algorithms, providing reference for disaster prevention and reduction in earthquake-affected areas. Five machine learning algorithms including K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are implemented and the sample dataset was prepared based on the landslide inventory map from open data repository. A total number of 4660 samples containing seismic landslides and non-landslide were collected. The influencing factors of seismic landslide include peak ground acceleration (PGA), epicenter distance, elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, fault distance, river distance, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The performance of five target machine learning algorithms is evaluated and compared using determination coefficient <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> and AUC value of ROC curve. The results indicate that the RF and SVM model have more accurate prediction ability with higher AUC value reaching 0.999 and 0.998, respectively, and the NR model has relatively poor performance resulting from the potential correlation of various influencing factors.

We trained for three classes: earthquake P‐wave, underground nuclear explosion (UNE) P‐wave, and noise. With the current absence of nuclear testing by countries that have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, high quality seismic data from UNEs is limited. Even with limited training data, our model can accurately characterize most events recorded at regional and teleseismic distances, finding over 95% signals in the validation set. We applied the model on holdout datasets of the North Korean test explosions to evaluate the performance on unique region and station‐source pairs, with promising results. Additionally, we tested on the Source Physics Experiment events to investigate the potential for chemical explosions to act as a surrogate for nuclear explosions. We anticipate that machine‐learning models like our classifier system can have broad application for other seismic signals including volcanic and non‐volcanic tremor, anomalous earthquakes, ice‐quakes or landslide‐quakes."

Recent geospatial practices advocated a multi-hazard analysis approach supported by artificial intelligence. This study proposes the Multi-Geoenvironmental Hazards Susceptibility (MGHS) tool, by combining Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Machine Learning (ML) over the North-Moungo perimeter (Littoral Region, Cameroon). Methods Twenty-four factors were constructed from satellite imagery, global geodatabase and fieldwork data. Multicollinearity among these factors was quantified using the tolerance coefficient (TOL) and variance inflation factor (VIF). The AHP coefficients were used to weigh the factors and produce a preliminary map per Geoenvironmental hazard through weighted linear combination (WLC). The sampling was conducted based on events records and analyst knowledge to proceed with classification using Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing interface. Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), were used as basic learners of the stacked hazard factors, whereas, Support Vector Regression (SVR), was used for a meta-learning. Results The rainfall was ranked as the highest triggering factor for all Geoenvironmental hazards according to AHP, with a coefficient of 1 , while the after-learning importance assessment was more varied. The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC/AUC) was always more than 0.96 , and F 1 -score is between [ 0.86–0.88 ] for basic classifiers. Landslides, gully erosion and flash floods showed different spatial distributions, confirming then their probability of co-occurrence. MGHS outputs clearly displayed two and three simultaneous occurrences. Finally, the human vulnerability assessed with population layer and SVR outputs showed that high human concentrations are also the most exposed, using the example of Nkongsamba’s extract. Conclusions Combining AHP with single learners, then a meta-learner, was efficient in modelling MGHS and related human vulnerability. Interactions among geo-environmental hazards are the next step and city councils are recommended to integrate results in the planning process."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods: A Case Study of Landslides in the Yinghu Lake Basin in Shaanxi,"Sheng Ma, Jian Chen, Saier Wu, Yurou Li",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/su152215836,https://openalex.org/W4388637224,"Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) is the basis for risk management and plays an important role in social sustainability. However, the modeling process of LSP is constrained by various factors. This paper approaches the effect of landslide data integrity, machine-learning (ML) models, and non-landslide sample-selection methods on the accuracy of LSP, taking the Yinghu Lake Basin in Ankang City, Shaanxi Province, as an example. First, previous landslide inventory (totaling 46) and updated landslide inventory (totaling 46 + 176) were established through data collection, remote-sensing interpretation, and field investigation. With the slope unit as the mapping unit, twelve conditioning factors, including elevation, slope, aspect, topographic relief, elevation variation coefficient, slope structure, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), distance to road, distance to river, and rainfall were selected. Next, the initial landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) was obtained using the K-means algorithm, and non-landslide samples were determined using two methods: random selection and semi-supervised machine learning (SSML). Finally, the random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning methods were used for modeling. The research results showed the following: (1) The performance of supervised machine learning (SML) (RF, ANN) is generally superior to unsupervised machine learning (USML) (K-means). Specifically, RF in the SML model has the best prediction performance, followed by ANN. (2) The selection method of non-landslide samples has a significant impact on LSP, and the accuracy of the SSML-based non-landslide selection method is controlled by the ratio of the number of landslide samples to the number of mapping units. (3) The quantity of landslides has an impact on how reliably the results of LSM are obtained because fewer landslides result in a smaller sample size for LSM, which deviates from reality. Although the results in this dataset are satisfactory, the zoning results cannot reliably anticipate the recently added landslide data discovered by the interpretation of remote-sensing data and field research. We propose that the landslide inventory can be increased by remote sensing in order to achieve accurate and impartial LSM since the LSM of adequate landslide samples is more reasonable. The research results of this paper will provide a reference basis for uncertain analysis of LSP and regional landslide risk management."

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the application of machine learning algorithms (SVM, RF, XGBoost and logistic regression) and compare the results for the modeling of landslide susceptibility in the province of Chañaral, III region, Chile. A total of 86 sites are identified using various sources, in addition to 86 non-landslide sites. This spatial data management and analysis are conducted using QGIS software. The sites are randomly divided, and then a cross-validation process is applied to calculate the accuracy of the models. After that, from 22 conditioning factors, 12 are chosen based on the information gain ratio (IGR). Subsequently, five factors are excluded by the correlation criterion. After this analysis, two indices not previously utilized in the literature, the NDGI (normalized difference glacier index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), are employed for the final model. The performance of the models is evaluated through the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC). To study the statistical behavior of the model, the Friedman nonparametric test is performed to compare the performance with the other algorithms and the Nemenyi test for pairwise comparison. Of the algorithms used, RF (AUC = 0.957) and XGBoost (AUC = 0.955) have the highest accuracy values measured in AUC compared to the other models and can be used for the same purpose in other geographic areas with similar characteristics.

Data on relevant geographical, demographic and socioeconomic aspects of the affected municipalities are also provided. These encompass geographic coordinates, regions, population, income, development indicators, amongst other information. From a statistical point of view, the data on disasters can address a number of applications using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as, for time series analysis or other dynamic models using socioeconomic data as explanatory variables, i.e. data on the size of the poor population, income, education and general development. The geographic dataset can be useful for aggregating analyses concerning the various forms of territorial organization and allows for the visualization of data in maps. All the aforementioned data can be also used to devise realistic optimization instances related to diverse humanitarian logistics and/or disaster management problems, such as facility location, location-allocation, vehicle routing, and so forth. In particular, we describe two real-world instances for the location-allocation problem studied in [1]. For that purpose, we partially use the given datasets and included other information such as costs and distances relevant to the optimization model. Although using real-world cases to test optimization approaches is a common and encouraged practice in Operations Research, comprehensive datasets and practical optimization instances, as presented in this article, are rarely described and/or available in the academic literature."

There is a crucial need for a good soil and water management system to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and other natural adverse events like floods and landslides, among others. Rainfall-runoff modeling is an appropriate approach for runoff prediction, making it possible to take preventive measures to avoid damage caused by natural hazards such as floods. In the present study, several data driven models, namely: Multiple linear regression (MLR), Multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), Support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), were used for rainfall-runoff prediction of the Gola watershed, located in the south-eastern part of the Uttarakhand. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBAIS) indices. In addition to the numerical comparison, the models were evaluated and their performances were evaluated base on graphical plotting, i.e., line diagram, scatter plot, Violin plot, relative error plot and Taylor diagram (TD). The comparison results revealed that the four heuristic methods gave higher accuracy than the MLR model. Among the machine learning models, the RF (RMSE (m3/s), R2, NSE, and PBIAS (%) = 6.31, 0.96, 0.94, and -0.20 during the training period, respectively, and 5.53, 0.95, 0.92, and -0.20 during the testing period, respectively) surpassed the MARS, SVM, and the MLR models in forecasting daily runoff for all cases studies. Among all four models, the RF model outperformed in the training and testing periods. It can be summarized that the RF model is best-in-class and delivers a strong potential for runoff prediction of the Gola watershed."

This study evaluated and compared the application of three machine learning algorithms, namely, extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), Random Forest (RF), and Naïve Bayes (NB), for a landslide susceptibility assessment in Awgu, Southeast Nigeria. A hazard assessment was conducted through a field investigation, remote sensing, and a consultation of past literature reviews, and 56 previous landslide locations were prepared from various data sources.

Before modeling the landslide susceptibility, the information gain ratio (IGR) was used to select and quantitatively describe the predictive ability of the conditioning factors. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to judge the correlation between 10 conditioning factors. In this study, rainfall is the most significant factor with respect to landslide distribution and occurrence. The confusion matrix, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), was used to validate and compare the models. According to the AUROC results, the prediction accuracy for the RF, NB, and XGBOOST models are 0.918, 0.916, and 0.902, respectively.

The performance of the models was evaluated using standard statistical measures including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, Area Under Curve (AUC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results revealed that all the models performed well (AUC > 0.80) in predicting flash flood susceptibility zones, but the performance of the DL model is the best (AUC: 0.972, RMSE: 0.352).

As a typical type of natural disaster, landslides may result in injuries to humans, threats to property security, and economic loss. As such, it is important to understand or predict the probability of landslide occurrence at potentially risky sites. Using typically machine learning (ML) to estimate landslide susceptibility based on a landslide inventory and a set of factors that impact the occurrence of landslides is a common practice. However, in landslide susceptibility assessment, existing DL-based neural network methods use a fully connected layer to optimize the selection of factors, which limits their efficiency in extracting features of those contributing factors. In response to those problems, this study proposed a CNN-LSTM model with an attention mechanism (AM) to avoid the complex optimization of input factors while the same or even better prediction accuracy can be achieved. To compare our method with the existing ones, the historical landslide inventory and the remote sensing data of Kerala, India were used to produce the input variables needed in the methods considered. The results show that our method produced more accurate results, compared to those existing neural network methods (e.g. CNN, LSTM and CNN-LSTM)."

The results showed that sewer material and age are the most significant factors, otherwise the network type is the least contributor affecting the sewer conditions in the study area. Among the considered ML models, the Extra Trees Regression (R2 = 0.90, MAE = 11.37, and RMSE = 40.75) outperformed the other ML models and it is recommended for predicting sewer conditions for the study area. The results of this study can support utilities and relevant agencies in planning predictive maintenance strategies for their sewer networks."
Automated digital data acquisition for landslide inventories,"Thomas Kreuzer, Bodo Damm",2020,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-020-01431-5,https://openalex.org/W3034384015,"Abstract Landslide research relies on landslide inventories for a multitude of spatial, temporal, or process analyses. Generally, it takes high effort to populate a landslide inventory with relevant data. In this context, the present work investigated an effective way to handle vast amounts of automatically acquired digital data for landslide inventories by the use of machine learning algorithms and information filtering. Between July 2017 and February 2019, a keyword alert system provided 4381 documents that were automatically processed to detect landslide events in Germany. Of all those documents, 91% were automatically recognized as irrelevant or duplicates; thereby, the data volume was significantly reduced to contain only actual landslide documents. Moreover, it was shown that inclusion of the document’s images into the automated process chain for information filtering is recommended, since otherwise unobtainable important information was found in them. Compared with manual methods, the automated process chain eliminated personal idiosyncrasies and human error and replaced it with a quantifiable machine error. The applied individual algorithms for natural language processing, information retrieval, and classification have been tried and tested in their respective fields. Furthermore, the proposed method is not restricted to a specific language or region. All languages on which these algorithms are applicable can be used with the proposed method and the training of the process chain can take any geographical restriction into account. Thus, the present work introduced a method with a quantifiable error to automatically classify and filter large amounts of data during automated digital data acquisition for landslide inventories."
Safety Prediction Model for Reinforced Highway Slope using a Machine Learning Method,"Asif Ahmed, Mohammad Sadik Khan, Sahadat Hossain, Tural Sadigov, Prabesh Bhandari",2020,https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198120924415,https://openalex.org/W3034419433,"Recycled plastic pin (RPP) has been proved to be an effective and inexpensive solution for shallow slope stabilization. Current practice suggests conducting numerical modeling to find out the desired factor of safety (FS) using RPP in the design of landslide repair. While the slope stability is heavily dependent on soil strength parameters and slope geometry, RPP length and spacing can also play a significant role in reaching the target factor of safety for the highway slope. During this study, a safety prediction model was developed using both statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches to use RPP in slope stabilization. Initially, parametric study was conducted using five different soil strengths, six slope heights, three slope ratios, three RPP lengths, and five RPP spacing configurations. Using the strength reduction techniques of Finite Element Modeling Software PLAXIS 2D, FS was determined for more than 1,000 combinations. Afterwards, a statistical approach was undertaken to determine a safety prediction model containing all possible parameters. Finally, an ML approach was conducted for safety model. The ML approach was found to be more accurate than the classical statistical approach with 85% accuracy of predicting the FS for an RPP reinforced highway slope. The developed model was validated against the values obtained from the numerical modeling, which indicated that the SF obtained from the developed model was in good agreement with those from finite element method (FEM) analysis."

The authors strongly believe that their model is more reliable as they are validating the tweets using news posts by providing various ratings according to the trueness."
"Application of seismic attributes and machine learning for imaging submarine slide blocks on the North Slope, Alaska","Shuvajit Bhattacharya, Miao Tian, Jon R. Rotzien, Sumit Verma",2020,https://doi.org/10.1190/segam2020-3426887.1,https://openalex.org/W3091242616,"Submarine landslides are mass movements that transport sedimentary materials across the continental shelf to the deep ocean when the shear stress exceeds the frictional resistance of the slope. In this study, we interpret and analyze the massive submarine landslides present in the Cretaceous Torok Formation on the North Slope, Alaska, using seismic attributes and machine learning methods. We employ amplitude and geometric attributes, such as coherent energy, Sobel-filter similarity, dip azimuth, and dip magnitude to image and interpret the slide blocks. Seismic attribute-based maps show the detailed pattern of the slide blocks. There are two distinct types of slide blocks: i) remnant blocks that consist of laterally continuous, high-amplitude reflections lacking extensive internal deformation, and ii) rafted blocks consisting of relatively lower amplitude reflectors, generally chaotic in nature, with significant internal deformation. The dimension of the slide blocks become smaller in size, more incoherent, and randomly distributed towards the distal portion of the basin. The presence of the organic-rich mudstone (Gamma-Ray Zone, GRZ) below the slide blocks introduces a velocity push-down effect that deteriorates the seismic imaging of the underlying sedimentary layers. This is a key challenge as many of these sedimentary units act as reservoirs on the North Slope. To aid in the automated mapping, we use a supervised probabilistic neural network (PNN) to characterize areas with slide blocks and without slide blocks. The results show that PNN can be used to map the presence of the slide blocks with high accuracy (~95.6%). We expect this method to aid in exploring the deep-water targets.

Utilizing a single-temporal full polarimetric Gaofen-3 SAR image to map coseismic landslide inventory following the 2017 Mw 7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake (China),"Rubing Liang, Keren Dai, Qiang Xu, Saied Pirasteh, Zhenhong Li, Tao Li, Ningling Wen, Jin Deng, Xuanmei Fan",2024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2024.103657,https://openalex.org/W4391074696,"On August 8, 2017, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Jiuzhaigou County in Sichuan Province, triggering numerous coseismic landslides. The prompt identification of these landslides is imperative for emergency rescue efforts and post-earthquake hazard assessments. Optical satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images are often obstructed by cloud cover and fog following earthquakes. In contrast, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR), unaffected by adverse weather conditions, emerges as an indispensable tool. However, the utilization of spaceborne single-temporal SAR for mapping the inventory of coseismic landslides is infrequent and encounters constraints due to several limitations. In this study, we analyzed the amplitude feature and polarimetric decomposition of multiple ground categories in a full PolSAR image, and proposed an automated method to accurately identify coseismic landslides using a single-temporal full PolSAR image. The coseismic landslide inventory following the Jiuzhaigou Earthquake was mapped and validated using high-resolution UAV images. Detailed analysis was conducted to identify error sources leading to omissions and false positives. Additionally, we evaluated various machine learning models to compare their performance with our proposed method. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of different data types (PolSAR, optical satellite, and UAV) for coseismic landslide identification. Our results indicate that the proposed PolSAR-based method achieves high accuracy in coseismic landslide inventory mapping, offering an effective solution for timely post-earthquake emergency responses in complex environments and all weather conditions in the future."

We apply PyLandslide to the case of rainfall-triggered landslides in Italy driven by historical precipitation data (1981–2023) and nine climate projections for the mid-century (2041–2050). Results highlight distance to roads as the most influential factor in determining landslide susceptibility in Italy, followed by slope. Our findings reveal an overall reduction in susceptibility in the mid-century compared to the historical period; however, the directional changes vary spatially. Uncertainty analysis should play a central role in decision-making on landslides, where weights are intricately linked to investments."

In this study, historical records of landslides in Yunnan Province, along with eight underlying factors of landslide (elevation, slope, aspect, lithology, land cover type, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil type, and average annual precipitation (AAP)), as well as historical rainfall and current rainfall data were utilized. Firstly, we analyzed the sensitivity of each underlying factor in the study area using the frequency ratio (FR) method and obtained a landslide susceptibility map (LSM). Then, we constructed a regional rainfall-induced landslides (RIL) probability forecasting model based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and divided warning levels. In order to construct a better RIL prediction model and explore the effects of different ML algorithms and input values of the underlying factor on the model, we compared five ML classification algorithms: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) algorithms and three representatives of the input values of the underlying factors. The results show that among the obtained forecasting models, the LSM-based RF model performs the best, with an accuracy (ACC) of 0.906, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.954, a probability of detection (POD) of 0.96 in the test set, and a prediction accuracy of 0.8 in the validation set.

Landslide risk assessment can help us know the risk of landslides occurring, which is an effective way to prevent landslide disasters in advance. In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly and has been used in a wide range of applications, especially for natural hazards. Based on the published literatures, this paper presents a detailed review of AI applications in landslide risk assessment. Three key areas where the application of AI is prominent are identified, including landslide detection, landslide susceptibility assessment, and prediction of landslide displacement. Machine learning (ML) containing deep learning (DL) has emerged as the primary technology which has been considered successfully due to its ability to quantify complex nonlinear relationships of soil structures and landslide predisposing factors. Among the algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are two models that are most widely used with satisfactory results in landslide risk assessment. The generalization ability, sampling training strategies, and hyper-parameters optimization of these models are crucial and should be carefully considered. The challenges and opportunities of AI applications are also fully discussed to provide suggestions for future research in landslide risk assessment."
"Study on Landslide Susceptibility Based on Multi-Model Coupling: A Case Study of Sichuan Province, China","Jinming Zhang, Jianxi Qian, Yuefeng Lu, Xueyuan Li, Zhenqi Song",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/su16166803,https://openalex.org/W4401411906,"Landslides are among the most prevalent geological hazards and are characterized by their high frequency, significant destructive potential, and considerable incident rate. Annually, these events lead to substantial casualties and property losses. Thus, conducting landslide susceptibility assessments in the regions vulnerable to such hazards has become crucial. In recent years, the coupling of traditional statistical methods with machine learning techniques has shown significant advantages in assessing landslide risk. This study focused on Sichuan Province, China, a region characterized by its vast area and diverse climatic and geological conditions. We selected 13 influencing factors for the analysis: elevation, slope, aspect, plan curve, profile curve, valley depth, precipitation, the stream power index (SPI), the topographic wetness index (TWI), the topographic position index (TPI), surface roughness, fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and slope height. This study incorporated the certainty factor method (CF), the information value method (IV), and their coupling with the decision tree C5.0 model (DT) and a logistic regression model (LR) as follows: IV-LR, IV-DT, CF-LR, and CF-DT. The results, validated by an ROC curve analysis, demonstrate that the evaluation accuracy of all six models exceeded 0.750 (AUC &gt; 0.750). The IV-LR model exhibited the highest accuracy, with an AUC of 0.848. When comparing the accuracy among the models, it is evident that the coupling models outperformed the individual statistical models. Based on the results of the six models, a landslide susceptibility map was generated, categorized into five levels. High and very high landslide risk zones are mainly concentrated in the eastern and southeastern regions, covering nearly half of Sichuan Province. Medium-risk areas form linear distributions from northeast to southwest, occupying a smaller proportion of the area. Extremely low- and low-risk zones are predominantly located in the western and northwestern regions. The density of the landslide points increases with higher risk levels across the regions. This further validates the suitability of this research methodology for landslide susceptibility studies on a large scale. Consequently, this methodology can provide crucial insights for landslide prevention and mitigation efforts in this region."

The framework can relatively accurately predict all the deformation stages from creeping deformation to critical sliding and features 4 advantages. (a) The forecast indices are established by combining deformation and disaster‐triggering characteristics to improve the prediction accuracy. (b) It leverages the advantage of C5.0 decision tree algorithm in knowledge interpretability to automatically extract deformation forecast criteria.

The potential of employing these techniques in spatiotemporal landslide forecasting remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study introduces an innovative dynamic (i.e., space–time-dependent) application of the random forest algorithm for evaluating landslide hazard (i.e., spatiotemporal probability of landslide occurrence). An area in Norway has been chosen as the case study because of the availability of a comprehensive, spatially, and temporally explicit rainfall-induced landslide inventory. The applied methodology is based on the inclusion of dynamic variables, such as cumulative rainfall, snowmelt, and their seasonal variability, as model inputs, together with traditional static parameters such as lithology and morphologic attributes. In this study, the variables’ importance was assessed and used to interpret the model decisions and to verify that they align with the physical mechanism responsible for landslide triggering. The algorithm, once trained and tested against landslide and non-landslide data sampled over space and time, produced a model predictor that was subsequently applied to the entire study area at different times: before, during, and after specific landslide events. For each selected day, a specific and space–time-dependent landslide hazard map was generated, then validated against field data. This study overcomes the traditional static applications of machine learning and demonstrates the applicability of a novel model aimed at spatiotemporal landslide probability assessment, with perspectives of applications to early warning systems."

It is of great significance to identify the key predisposing factors of landslides and to reveal the landslide susceptibility in this area. A total of 2,308 landslides were identified as learning samples through remote sensing interpretation and detailed field surveys, and four machine learning algorithms involving logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), naïve Bayes (NB) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were compared to model the landslide susceptibility. Through the multicollinearity test, 13 influential factors were selected as conditioning factors. The area under the curve (AUC) values of LR, RF, NB and MLP models are .788, .918, .785 and .836 respectively, indicating that the four models have good or very good prediction accuracy in landslide susceptibility assessment along the Yunnan–Tibet traffic corridor. In addition, the elevation, slope, rainfall, distance to rivers, and aspect play a major role in landslide development in the study area. The susceptibility zoning map based on the best RF model shows that the areas with high susceptibility and very high susceptibility account for 12.24% and 6.72%, respectively, and are mainly distributed along the Jinsha River, the Lancang River and the G214 highway."

Landslides lead to severe economic damage and property loss, as well as fatalities. Furthermore, they tend to increase in the context of climate change. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively assess landslide susceptibility across the Hengduan Mountain Region in southwest China. Specifically, the analysis is focused on the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau within the context of future climate change scenarios, which are based on the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate model ensemble. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) were selected in order to map landslide susceptibility within the context of 1.5–4.0 °C warming scenarios. This was achieved by considering the changes in extreme rainfall that exceeded the landslide triggering thresholds. The results show that the frequency over extreme rainfall thresholds (FOERT) tend to increase in conjunction with warming targets, thereby ranging from 2.3/a (at a 1.5 °C warming) to 9.0/a (at a 4.0 °C warming) on average. Such elevated extreme precipitation events contribute to an increase in projected future zones of high landslide susceptibility when compared to the historical baseline period ranging from −1.2% (at a 1.5 °C warming) to 4.0% (at a 4.0 °C warming) using different machine learning models. Moreover, the extent of high susceptibility zones increases more significantly in the context of 4.0 °C warming when compared to the historical baseline results. These results indicate the importance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 as well as 2 °C. The high landslide susceptibility zones estimated by the CMIP6 multi-models ensemble are mainly located in the central and southeastern regions of the Hengduan Mountain Region. The possible changes in terms of introducing extreme precipitation in order to assess landslide susceptibility in the context of climate change that is proposed in this study may be further applied to additional study areas. These projections under different targets can provide scientific guidelines for the purposes of the development of climate change adaptation strategies."

This study evaluates the capability of different machine learning (ML) methods for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in mountainous regions in the Colorado Front Range. A well-documented and georeferenced landslide inventory for the Colorado Front Range area was used to construct the database for developing and testing ML models. Nine landslide contributing factors were collected for the present study based on the availability of geophysical data and the type of landslides that occurred in the study area. These landslide causative factors represent hillslope geometries, surface hydrology, and soil conditions. Five commonly used ML models were evaluated: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). The cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the model performance. All the trained models reflected the relationship between landslides and their causative factors in the study area based on cross-validation results. It was found that the performance varied among the ML models; the RF model exhibited the worst performance due to possible overfitting, and the RF and the GBM models achieved the highest performance. The trained models were subsequently used to predict the landslide susceptibility for the entire study area and generate a landslide susceptibility map. The landslide susceptibility map can provide situational awareness of potential landslide hazards within the Colorado Front Range area and provide guidelines for future decision-making."
Analysis of Optimal Buffer Distance for Linear Hazard Factors in Landslide Susceptibility Prediction,"Fang Lü, Qian Wang, Jianping Yue, Yin Xing",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/su151310180,https://openalex.org/W4382403037,"A linear hazard-causing factor is the environmental element of landslide susceptibility prediction, and the setting of buffer distance of a linear hazard-causing factor has an important influence on the accuracy of landslide susceptibility prediction based on machine learning algorithms. A geographic information system (GIS) has generally been accepted in the correlation analysis between linear hazard-causing factors and landslides; the most common are statistical models based on buffer zone analysis and superposition analysis for linear causative factor distances and landslide counts. However, there is a problem in the process of model building: the buffer distance that is used to build the statistical model and its statistical results can appropriately reflect the correlation between the linear disaster-causing factors and landslides. To solve this problem, a statistical model of landslide density and distance of linear disaster-causing factors under different single-loop buffer distances was established based on Pearson’s method with 12 environmental factors, such as elevation, topographic relief, and distance from the water system and road, in Ruijin City, Jiangxi Province to obtain the most relevant single-loop buffer distance linear disaster-causing factor combinations; random forest (RF) machine learning models were then used to predict landslide susceptibility. Finally, the Kappa coefficient and the distribution characteristics of the susceptibility index were used to investigate the modeling laws. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy of the most correlated single-loop buffer distance combination reaches 96.65%, the error rate of non-landslide points is 4.2%, and the error of landslide points is 11.3%, which is higher than the same single-loop buffer distance combination, confirming the reasonableness of the method of using correlation to obtain the linear disaster-causing factor buffer distance."

With the potential uncertainty of susceptibility changes in mountain environments due to different precipitation thresholds related to climate change, it becomes important to evaluate these changes. In this study, we employed a machine learning approach (logistic models) to assess susceptibility changes to landslides in the Central Andes. We integrated geomorphological features such as slope and slope curvature, and precipitation data on different days before the landslide. We then split the data into a calibration and validation database in a 50/50% ratio, respectively. The results showed an area under the curve (AUC) performance of over 0.790, indicating the model’s capacity to represent prone-landslide changes based on geomorphological and precipitation antecedents. We further evaluated susceptibility changes using different precipitation scenarios by integrating Intensity/Duration/Frequency (IDF) products based on CHIRPS data. We concluded that this methodology could be implemented as a Rainfall-Induced Landslides Early Warning System (RILEWS) to forecast RIL occurrence zones and constrain precipitation thresholds. Our study estimates that half of the basin area in the study zone showed a 59% landslide probability for a return of two years at four hours. Given the extent and high population in the area, authorities must increase monitoring over unstable slopes or generate landslide early warning at an operational scale to improve risk management. We encourage decision-makers to focus on better understanding and analysing short-duration extreme events, and future urbanization and public infrastructure designs must consider RIL impact."

To track the immediate changes in soil stability, it is essential to monitor multiple environmental parameters using Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time decision-making. Further, the relation between the environmental parameters and FOS is non-linear which makes it a multivariate and complex problem. To motivate the above-mentioned challenges, in this paper, we propose a new Fusion-based Bag-of-Neural Network (FuBoNN) model for predicting FOS using a set of IoT devices in edge networks. Besides that, for increasing the prediction accuracy of FOS, multiple laboratory data related to FOS are fused over the monitoring parameters and prepare a rich dataset. The newly created fused dataset is fed into the population-based Neural Network (NN) and the best NN is selected in each iteration that transfers its knowledge to the population. The fused dataset is categorized into four class labels to simulate the stability issue of residual soil and fed to the input of the proposed FuBoNN model, which provides a 0.0003% of error in predicting the multiple categories of the FOS. The proposed work is compared to the standard machine learning models that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and produce 2.5% improved prediction accuracy over the existing ones."
Investigation of Landslide Susceptibility Decision Mechanisms in Different Ensemble-Based Machine Learning Models with Various Types of Factor Data,"Jiakai Lu, Chao Ren, Weiting Yue, Ying Zhou, Xiaoqin Xue, Yuanyuan Liu, Cong Ding",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/su151813563,https://openalex.org/W4386601961,"Machine learning (ML)-based methods of landslide susceptibility assessment primarily focus on two dimensions: accuracy and complexity. The complexity is not only influenced by specific model frameworks but also by the type and complexity of the modeling data. Therefore, considering the impact of factor data types on the model’s decision-making mechanism holds significant importance in assessing regional landslide characteristics and conducting landslide risk warnings given the achievement of good predictive performance for landslide susceptibility using excellent ML methods. The decision-making mechanism of landslide susceptibility models coupled with different types of factor data in machine learning methods was explained in this study by utilizing the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. Furthermore, a comparative analysis was carried out to examine the differential effects of diverse data types for identical factors on model predictions. The study area selected was Cenxi, Guangxi, where a geographic spatial database was constructed by combining 23 landslide conditioning factors with 214 landslide samples from the region. Initially, the factors were standardized using five conditional probability models, frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV), certainty factor (CF), evidential belief function (EBF), and weights of evidence (WOE), based on the spatial arrangement of landslides. This led to the formation of six types of factor databases using the initial data. Subsequently, two ensemble-based ML methods, random forest (RF) and XGBoost, were utilized to build models for predicting landslide susceptibility. Various evaluation metrics were employed to compare the predictive capabilities of different models and determined the optimal model. Simultaneously, the analysis was conducted using the interpretable SHAP method for intrinsic decision-making mechanisms of different ensemble-based ML models, with a specific focus on explaining and comparing the differential impacts of different types of factor data on prediction results. The results of the study illustrated that the XGBoost-CF model constructed with CF values of factors not only exhibited the best predictive accuracy and stability but also yielded more reasonable results for landslide susceptibility zoning, and was thus identified as the optimal model. The global interpretation results revealed that slope was the most crucial factor influencing landslides, and its interaction with other factors in the study area collectively contributed to landslide occurrences. The differences in the internal decision-making mechanisms of models based on different data types for the same factors primarily manifested in the extent of influence on prediction results and the dependency of factors, providing an explanation for the performance of standardized data in ML models and the reasons behind the higher predictive performance of coupled models based on conditional probability models and ML methods. Through comprehensive analysis of the local interpretation results from different models analyzing the same sample with different sample characteristics, the reasons for model prediction errors can be summarized, thereby providing a reference framework for constructing more accurate and rational landslide susceptibility models and facilitating landslide warning and management."

Common methods are mainly based on empirical relationships that provide the rainfall thresholds above which the occurrence of landslide phenomena is likely to be expected. In recent years, the use of machine learning approaches has gained popularity in landslide susceptibility analysis and prediction. To support the operational early warning system of Liguria Civil Protection Department for landslides hazard, we propose the implementation of a polynomial Kernel regularized least squares regression (KRLS) algorithm, for predicting the daily occurrence of shallow landslides in the five Alert Zones in Liguria (North Western Italy). The model provides an estimate of the number of landslides associated with the set of three different hydrological features, also used for the Hydrological Assessment procedure: the soil moisture, the accumulated precipitation over 12 h and the precipitation peak over 3 h. Results of the model are converted to an Alert Scenario of landslide occurrence, based on the magnitude of the expected event and identified according to the National and Regional legislation (Regional Civil Protection guidelines D.G.R. n. 1116, 23/12/2020). The performance of the predictive model (e.g. accuracy of 93%) is deemed satisfactory and the methodology is considered a valuable support to the operational early warning system of Liguria Civil Protection Department. The choice of predictive variables allows, in future development, the values obtained from historical data to be replaced by those obtained from meteorological forecast models, introducing the use of the developed model in the operational forecasting chain."

This study presents a methodology for economic risk assessment of structures affected by rainfall-induced landslides using machine learning (ML). Random Forest and LightGBM algorithms were applied to develop ML-based landslide prediction models considering the spatial distributions of landslide conditioning and triggering factors. The rainfall index was calculated considering the temporal variation in rainfall and was used as a feature associated with rainfall intensity. The rainfall hazard curve, representing the relationship between the rainfall index and its annual exceedance probability, was statistically estimated using a generalised extreme value distribution. Rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility was assessed using an ML-based landslide prediction model and rainfall hazard curve. Finally, the risk curve associated with the economic loss from structures damaged by rainfall-induced landslides was estimated based on landslide susceptibility and structure distribution maps. In this study, LightGBM showed better prediction performance for evaluating rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility than Random Forest. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used to develop an appropriate risk-based disaster mitigation strategy."

It has been proven that convolutional neural networks have better performance for LIM than traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF). However, the accuracy of existing methods based only on optical images is low due to the complex landslide background. Moreover, the multi-scale features of landslides are not considered in convolutional neural network methods. Therefore, this study proposes Multi-featured independent component analysis UNet3+ (MICUNet3+) for landslide inventory mapping based on optical images, which combines co-feature, independent component analysis (ICA), and UNet3+. Firstly, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are extracted from remote sensing images acquired pre- and post- earthquake event and then processed by change vector analysis. Then, ICA is implemented for NDVI, GLCM, and three elevation factors. Lastly, the three principal components and the post-event images are fed into UNet3+ to generate LIM by multi-scale features and deep supervision. Finally, we validate the proposed method by using the co-seismic landslide of Jiuzhaigou earthquake as an experiment. The results show that the performance of recall, F1-score and mIoU are 0.13, 0.22 and 0.11 higher than those of the post-event-only images, respectively, indicating that the proposed method can effectively solve the problems of landslide identification in terms of multi-scale features and complex background."

Traditional methods, including physics-based methods and empirical methods, are beset by high costs and a reliance on expert knowledge. With the advancement of remote sensing and machine learning, data-driven methods have emerged as the mainstream in landslide prediction. Despite their strong generalization capabilities and efficiency, data-driven methods suffer from the loss of semantic information during training due to their reliance on a ‘sequence’ modeling method for landslide scenarios, which impacts their predictive accuracy. An innovative method for landslide prediction is proposed in this paper. In this paper, we propose an innovative landslide prediction method. This method designs the NADE ontology as the schema layer and constructs the data layer of the knowledge graph, utilizing tile lists, landslide inventory, and environmental data to enhance the representation of complex landslide scenarios. Furthermore, the transformation of the landslide prediction task into a link prediction task is carried out, and a knowledge graph embedding model is trained to achieve landslide predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method improves the F1 score by 5% in scenarios with complete datasets and 17% in scenarios with sparse datasets compared to data-driven methods. Additionally, the application of the knowledge graph embedding model is utilized to generate susceptibility maps, and an analysis of the effectiveness of entity embeddings is conducted, highlighting the potential of knowledge graph embeddings in disaster management."

The study uses results from the most recent landslides analysis of GIS data and soft computing techniques to describe a concept for determining risk in a housing development situated on the hillside. The concepts presented by this study are timely, which means that computations define the time in which the housing development becomes vulnerable to landslides. The general idea enclosed in this research was to merge recent landslides analysis with real-life situations. The study location for this research was an already developed area situated along the hillside slopes of Bukit Antrabangsa, Malaysia. The approach includes predicting landslides using a novel machine-learning algorithm ensemble, the random subspace technique. The prediction process relates to the probability of occurrence of the slides responsible for the vulnerability of the housing development. A landslides prediction technique that employs GIS data to develop a geospatial database and machine learning algorithms for predicting future occurrences was used to produce the landslides inventory. The study area’s landslide inventory was then used as reference locations to predict landslide occurrence under the influence of ten landslide predisposing factors. Prediction results were evaluated for accuracy using the ROC (receiver operator characteristics) and calculated the AUC (area under the curve). Other parameters used to decide the quality of the models include the RSME (root-mean-square error), the MAE (mean absolute error), and the F-measure. The results obtained from the statistical analysis of the model show that the model has high predictive and success rates. The soft computing results now gave ways to obtain a timely probability of occurrence of the slides using a deterministic approach. The analysis was concluded by providing a conceptual equation to determine the timely probability of the slides using the available hazard information."

The research areas had 242 landslide locations, and the inventory data was arbitrarily separated into training and testing datasets in a 7/3 ratio. As prediction parameters, ten spatial databases of landslides conditioning factors were employed. The area under the curve (AUC) was utilized as the models' performance metric. With an AUC score of 87.52 %, the final analysis showed that KNN had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by Random Forest (84.34 %) and XGBoost (78.07%). According to the AUC findings, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost performed consistently well in forecasting landslide susceptibility. The final forecast map can be a helpful tool for urban planning and development and for aiding the authorities in creating a strategic mitigation plan."

The purpose of this preliminary study is to demonstrate that machine learning techniques can be used to analyze monitoring data in order to select the most relevant variables for the triggering of shallow rainfall-induced landslides at regional scale. The models developed herein were tested in one of the alert zones defined by civil protection for the management of geo-hydrological risk in Campania region, Italy. Two data sources were used in the analysis. The atmospheric variables are derived from the ERA5-Land atmospheric reanalysis. The data on landslide events are retrieved from “FraneItalia”, a georeferenced catalog of landslides occurred in Italy developed by consulting online sources from 2010 onwards. The models developed were calibrated and validated in order to define combinations of rainfall variables and soil water content for the prediction of the occurrence of landslides.

The traditional regional landslide disaster early-warning model, however, is limited by the complex landslide induction mechanism, limited data accumulation, and insufficient big data analysis methods, and has problems such as limited early-warning accuracy and insufficient refinement. In this paper, a machine learning method was introduced into the field of regional landslide disaster warning. From the model construction process of training sample-set construction, sample learning and training, model parameter optimization, model preservation, warning output, and so on, a method for constructing a regional landslide early-warning model based on machine learning was systematically proposed. In the sample learning and training, 80% of the training sample-set was used as the training set, and 20% was used as the test set for five-fold cross validation. The Bayesian Optimization algorithm was used to optimize the model parameters, and the accuracy, ROC curve, and AUC value were used to verify the model accuracy and model generalization ability. With China’s Fujian province as an example, based on nine years of geological and meteorological data (2010–2018), geological environment factors, factors of hazard-affected bodies and historical disaster situations, and rainfall-induced factors in four categories, a total of 26 indicators were used as input characteristic parameters. Six machine learning algorithms were adopted to improve model training; the results showed that the Random Forest algorithm performed the best, giving an accuracy of 92.3%, and was the model with the best generalization ability (AUC was 0.955). The second best was the Artificial Neural Network model, with an accuracy of 0.937 and an AUC of 0.935. Next were the Nearest Neighbor model, the Logistic Regression model, and the Support Vector Machine; the poorest results were from the Decision Tree model. Finally, the typical rainfall-type landslide disaster process in Fujian Province was selected as an example to verify the Random Forest algorithm model. The results showed that compared with the early-warning results of the original explicit statistical model, the hit rate of the new model was 6 times, or equal to that of the original model, and the landslide density in the early-warning area of the new model was 1.6–1.7 times that of the original model. Preliminary verification showed that the new model based on the Random Forest method has obvious advantages, a higher hit rate and a smaller warning area, and can achieve more accurate warnings. The follow-up will continue to track the new landslide disaster situation in the study area and carry out model verification and correction."

To further check and validate the process, it was compared with a more recent approach that is the soft computing (machine learning) technique. After the comparison, the enhanced analytical hierarchy process performed wonderfully well but not better than the machine learning method of analysis. Using the AHP methods, it was able to identify rainfall precipitation to be the major trigger mechanisms while 12 other conditioning factors were also identified. From the results obtained, it was observed that a good portion of the study area can be said to be susceptible to landslides. The analysis suggested that though the slides were fully triggered by rainfall precipitation, other factors such the geological and hydrological conditions facilitate the rapid occurrences of the phenomenal landslides in the study area.

Over the past ten years, damages caused by earthquakes in human settlements are found to be increasing. Recently, landslide prediction using Radial Basis Function of Support Vector Machine with an accuracy of 91.2% is reported. With landslide prediction probability, there are two possibilities: a landslide occurrence or non-occurrence. In either cases, the prediction could be correct or false. In the first case, false prediction could result in loss of human life and property, while correct prediction is valuable. But in the latter case, false prediction could lead to human stress & strain, expensive disaster prevention measures and so on, while correct prediction is appreciable. Hence, to minimize losses it is essential to predict the landslide accurately. With this intention, prediction algorithms with high accuracy are developed. Landslide prediction using machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Method, and Random-forest are proposed. The accuracy reported by these techniques is low and so prediction using deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network is attempted. Performance measures of these methods are evaluated using the three pillars of binary classification namely accuracy, precision and recall. The results of the deep learning models outperform the machine learning models in order namely Logistic-Regression, Support-Vector-Machine, and Naïve-Bayes classifier."
