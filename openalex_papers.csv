"Landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning algorithms and comparison of their performance at Abha Basin, Asir Region, Saudi Arabia","Ahmed M. Youssef, Hamid Reza Pourghasemi",2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.05.010,https://openalex.org/W3036091573,"The current study aimed at evaluating the capabilities of seven advanced machine learning techniques (MLTs), including, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes (NB), for landslide susceptibility modeling and comparison of their performances. Coupling machine learning algorithms with spatial data types for landslide susceptibility mapping is a vitally important issue. This study was carried out using GIS and R open source software at Abha Basin, Asir Region, Saudi Arabia. First, a total of 243 landslide locations were identified at Abha Basin to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data sources. All the landslide areas were randomly separated into two groups with a ratio of 70% for training and 30% for validating purposes. Twelve landslide-variables were generated for landslide susceptibility modeling, which include altitude, lithology, distance to faults, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse/landcover (LULC), distance to roads, slope angle, distance to streams, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope length (LS), and slope-aspect. The area under curve (AUC-ROC) approach has been applied to evaluate, validate, and compare the MLTs performance. The results indicated that AUC values for seven MLTs range from 89.0% for QDA to 95.1% for RF. Our findings showed that the RF (AUC ​= ​95.1%) and LDA (AUC ​= ​941.7%) have produced the best performances in comparison to other MLTs. The outcome of this study and the landslide susceptibility maps would be useful for environmental protection."
Landslide identification using machine learning,"Haojie Wang, Limin Zhang, K.S. Yin, Hongyu Luo, Jinhui Li",2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.02.012,https://openalex.org/W3010757542,"Landslide identification is critical for risk assessment and mitigation. This paper proposes a novel machine-learning and deep-learning method to identify natural-terrain landslides using integrated geodatabases. First, landslide-related data are compiled, including topographic data, geological data and rainfall-related data. Then, three integrated geodatabases are established; namely, Recent Landslide Database (RecLD), Relict Landslide Database (RelLD) and Joint Landslide Database (JLD). After that, five machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosting methods and convolutional neural network (CNN), are utilized and evaluated on each database. A case study in Lantau, Hong Kong, is conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. From the results of the case study, CNN achieves an identification accuracy of 92.5% on RecLD, and outperforms other algorithms due to its strengths in feature extraction and multi dimensional data processing. Boosting methods come second in terms of accuracy, followed by RF, LR and SVM. By using machine learning and deep learning techniques, the proposed landslide identification method shows outstanding robustness and great potential in tackling the landslide identification problem."
Deep learning-based landslide susceptibility mapping,"Mohammad Azarafza, Mehdi Azarafza, Haluk Akgün, Peter M. Atkinson, Reza Derakhshani",2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-03585-1,https://openalex.org/W4200108305,"Landslides are considered as one of the most devastating natural hazards in Iran, causing extensive damage and loss of life. Landslide susceptibility maps for landslide prone areas can be used to plan for and mitigate the consequences of catastrophic landsliding events. Here, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN-DNN) for mapping landslide susceptibility, and evaluated it on the Isfahan province, Iran, which has not previously been assessed on such a scale. The proposed model was trained and validated using training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets, each containing relevant data on historical landslides, field records and remote sensing images, and a range of geomorphological, geological, environmental and human activity factors as covariates. The CNN-DNN model prediction accuracy was tested using a wide range of statistics from the confusion matrix and error indices from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The CNN-DNN model was evaluated comprehensively by comparing it to several state-of-the-art benchmark machine learning techniques including the support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bernoulli Naïve Bayes (BNB) and decision tree (DT) classifiers. The CNN-DNN model for landslide susceptibility mapping was found to predict more accurately than the benchmark algorithms, with an AUC = 90.9%, IRs = 84.8%, MSE = 0.17, RMSE = 0.40, and MAPE = 0.42. The map provided by the CNN-DNN clearly revealed a high-susceptibility area in the west and southwest, related to the main Zagros trend in the province. These findings can be of great utility for landslide risk management and land use planning in the Isfahan province."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Based on Remote Sensing Images and GIS: Comparisons of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Models,"Zhilu Chang, Zhen Du, Fan Zhang, Faming Huang, Jiawu Chen, Wenbin Li, Zizheng Guo",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030502,https://openalex.org/W3004932743,"Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) has been widely and effectively implemented by machine learning (ML) models based on remote sensing (RS) images and Geographic Information System (GIS). However, comparisons of the applications of ML models for LSP from the perspectives of supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (USML) have not been explored. Hence, this study aims to compare the LSP performance of these SML and USML models, thus further to explore the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models and to realize a more accurate and reliable LSP result. Two representative SML models (support vector machine (SVM) and CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)) and two representative USML models (K-means and Kohonen models) are respectively used to scientifically predict the landslide susceptibility indexes, and then these prediction results are discussed. Ningdu County with 446 recorded landslides obtained through field investigations is introduced as case study. A total of 12 conditioning factors are obtained through procession of Landsat TM 8 images and high-resolution aerial images, topographical and hydrological spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in GIS software, and government reports. The area value under the curve of receiver operating features (AUC) is applied for evaluating the prediction accuracy of SML models, and the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy is then introduced to compare the remarkable prediction performance differences between SML and USML models. Overall, the receiver operation curve (ROC) results show that the AUC of the SVM is 0.892 and is slightly greater than the AUC of the CHAID model (0.872). The FR accuracy results show that the SVM model has the highest accuracy for LSP (77.80%), followed by the CHAID model (74.50%), the Kohonen model (72.8%) and the K-means model (69.7%), which indicates that the SML models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the USML models. It can be concluded that selecting recorded landslides as prior knowledge to train and test the LSP models is the key reason for the higher prediction accuracy of the SML models, while the lack of a priori knowledge and target guidance is an important reason for the low LSP accuracy of the USML models. Nevertheless, the USML models can also be used to implement LSP due to their advantages of efficient modeling processes, dimensionality reduction and strong scalability."
Review on remote sensing methods for landslide detection using machine and deep learning,"Amrita Mohan, Amit Kumar Singh, Basant Kumar, R. S. Dwivedi",2020,https://doi.org/10.1002/ett.3998,https://openalex.org/W3037891846,"Abstract Landslide, one of the most critical natural hazards, is caused due to specific compositional slope movement. In the past decades, due to inflation of urbanized area and climate change, a compelling expansion in landslide prevalence took place which is also termed as mass/slope movement and mass wasting, causing extensive collapse around the world. The principal reason for its pursuance is a reduction in the internal resistance of soil and rocks, classified as a slide, topple, fall, and flow. Slopes can be differentiated based on earth material and the nature of its movements. The downward flow of landslides occurs due to excessive rainfall, snowmelt, earthquake, volcanic eruption, and so on. This review article revisits the conventional approaches for identification of landslides, predicting future risk, associated with slope failures, followed by emphasizing the advantages of modern geospatial techniques such as aerial photogrammetry, satellite remote sensing images (ie, panchromatic, multispectral, radar images), Terrestrial laser scanning, and High‐Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HR‐DEM) in updating landslide inventory maps. Machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine, Artificial neural network, deep learning has been extensively used with geographical data producing effective results for assessment of natural hazard/resources and environmental research. Based on recent studies, deep learning is a reliable tool addressing remote sensing challenges such as trade‐off in imaging system producing poor quality investigation, in addition, to expedite consequent task such as image recognition, object detection, classification, and so on. Conventional methods, like pixel and object‐based machine learning methods, have been broadly explored. Advanced development in deep learning technique like CNN (Convolutional neural network) has been extensively successful in information extraction from an image and has exceeded other traditional approaches. Over the past few years, minor attempts have been made for landslide susceptibility mapping using CNN. In addition, small sample sizes for training purpose will be major drawback and notably remarkable while using deep learning techniques. Also, assessment of the model's performance with diverse training and testing proportion other than commonly utilized ratio, that is, 70/30 needs to be explored further. The review article briefly highlights the remote sensing methods for landslide detection using machine learning and deep learning."

As a result, many scientists study the phenomenon, and some of them have focused on producing landslide susceptibility maps that can be used by land-use managers to reduce injury and damage. This paper contributes to this effort by comparing the power and effectiveness of five machine learning, benchmark algorithms—Logistic Model Tree, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine—in creating a reliable shallow landslide susceptibility map for Bijar City in Kurdistan province, Iran. Twenty conditioning factors were applied to 111 shallow landslides and tested using the One-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique for modeling and validation processes. The performance of the models was assessed by statistical-based indexes including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results indicate that all the five machine learning models performed well for shallow landslide susceptibility assessment, but the Logistic Model Tree model (AUC = 0.932) had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, followed by the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.932), Naïve Bayes Tree (AUC = 0.864), ANN (AUC = 0.860), and Support Vector Machine (AUC = 0.834) models. Therefore, we recommend the use of the Logistic Model Tree model in shallow landslide mapping programs in semi-arid regions to help decision makers, planners, land-use managers, and government agencies mitigate the hazard and risk."
A comparative study of heterogeneous ensemble-learning techniques for landslide susceptibility mapping,"Zhice Fang, Yi Wang, Ling Peng, Haoyuan Hong",2020,https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2020.1808897,https://openalex.org/W3087192809,"This study introduces four heterogeneous ensemble-learning techniques, that is, stacking, blending, simple averaging, and weighted averaging, to predict landslide susceptibility in Yanshan County, China. These techniques combine several state-of-the-art classifiers of convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, support vector machine, and logistic regression in specific ways to produce reliable results and avoid problems with the model selection. The study consists of three main steps. The first step establishes a spatial database consisting of 16 landslide conditioning factors and 380 historical landslide locations. The second step randomly selects training (70% of the total) and test (30%) datasets out of grid cells corresponding to landslide and non-slide locations in the study area. The final step constructs the proposed heterogeneous ensemble-learning methods for landslide susceptibility mapping. The proposed ensemble-learning methods show higher prediction accuracy than the individual classifiers mentioned above based on statistical measures. The blending ensemble-learning method achieves the highest overall accuracy of 80.70% compared to the other ensemble-learning methods."
Mapping Landslides on EO Data: Performance of Deep Learning Models vs. Traditional Machine Learning Models,"Nikhil Prakash, Andrea Manconi, Simon Loew",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030346,https://openalex.org/W3001525167,"Mapping landslides using automated methods is a challenging task, which is still largely done using human efforts. Today, the availability of high-resolution EO data products is increasing exponentially, and one of the targets is to exploit this data source for the rapid generation of landslide inventory. Conventional methods like pixel-based and object-based machine learning strategies have been studied extensively in the last decade. In addition, recent advances in CNN (convolutional neural network), a type of deep-learning method, has been widely successful in extracting information from images and have outperformed other conventional learning methods. In the last few years, there have been only a few attempts to adapt CNN for landslide mapping. In this study, we introduce a modified U-Net model for semantic segmentation of landslides at a regional scale from EO data using ResNet34 blocks for feature extraction. We also compare this with conventional pixel-based and object-based methods. The experiment was done in Douglas County, a study area selected in the south of Portland in Oregon, USA, and landslide inventory extracted from SLIDO (Statewide Landslide Information Database of Oregon) was considered as the ground truth. Landslide mapping is an imbalanced learning problem with very limited availability of training data. Our network was trained on a combination of focal Tversky loss and cross-entropy loss functions using augmented image tiles sampled from a selected training area. The deep-learning method was observed to have a better performance than the conventional methods with an MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) score of 0.495 and a POD (probability of detection) rate of 0.72 ."
"Slope stability prediction using ensemble learning techniques: A case study in Yunyang County, Chongqing, China","Wengang Zhang, Hongrui Li, Liang Han, Longlong Chen, Lin Wang",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2021.12.011,https://openalex.org/W4206280001,"Slope stability prediction plays a significant role in landslide disaster prevention and mitigation. This study develops an ensemble learning-based method to predict the slope stability by introducing the random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). As an illustration, the proposed approach is applied to the stability prediction of 786 landslide cases in Yunyang County, Chongqing, China. For comparison, the predictive performance of RF, XGBoost, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) is systematically investigated based on the well-established confusion matrix, which contains the known indices of recall rate, precision, and accuracy. Furthermore, the feature importance of the 12 influencing variables is also explored. Results show that the accuracy of the XGBoost and RF for both the training and testing data is superior to that of SVM and LR, revealing the superiority of the ensemble learning models (i.e. XGBoost and RF) in the slope stability prediction of Yunyang County. Among the 12 influencing factors, the profile shape is the most important one. The proposed ensemble learning-based method offers a promising way to rationally capture the slope status. It can be extended to the prediction of slope stability of other landslide-prone areas of interest."
Landslide susceptibility zonation method based on C5.0 decision tree and K-means cluster algorithms to improve the efficiency of risk management,"Zizheng Guo, Yu Shi, Faming Huang, Xuanmei Fan, Jinsong Huang",2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2021.101249,https://openalex.org/W3169157623,"Machine learning algorithms are an important measure with which to perform landslide susceptibility assessments, but most studies use GIS-based classification methods to conduct susceptibility zonation. This study presents a machine learning approach based on the C5.0 decision tree (DT) model and the K-means cluster algorithm to produce a regional landslide susceptibility map. Yanchang County, a typical landslide-prone area located in northwestern China, was taken as the area of interest to introduce the proposed application procedure. A landslide inventory containing 82 landslides was prepared and subsequently randomly partitioned into two subsets: training data (70% landslide pixels) and validation data (30% landslide pixels). Fourteen landslide influencing factors were considered in the input dataset and were used to calculate the landslide occurrence probability based on the C5.0 decision tree model. Susceptibility zonation was implemented according to the cut-off values calculated by the K-means cluster algorithm. The validation results of the model performance analysis showed that the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) of the proposed model was the highest, reaching 0.88, compared with traditional models (support vector machine (SVM) = 0.85, Bayesian network (BN) = 0.81, frequency ratio (FR) = 0.75, weight of evidence (WOE) = 0.76). The landslide frequency ratio and frequency density of the high susceptibility zones were 6.76/km2 and 0.88/km2, respectively, which were much higher than those of the low susceptibility zones. The top 20% interval of landslide occurrence probability contained 89% of the historical landslides but only accounted for 10.3% of the total area. Our results indicate that the distribution of high susceptibility zones was more focused without containing more ""stable"" pixels. Therefore, the obtained susceptibility map is suitable for application to landslide risk management practices."
"Landslide Susceptibility Evaluation and Management Using Different Machine Learning Methods in The Gallicash River Watershed, Iran","Alireza Arabameri, Sunil Saha, Jagabandhu Roy, Wei Chen, Thomas Blaschke, Dieu Tien Bui",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030475,https://openalex.org/W3005376489,"This analysis aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) using various machine learning methods, namely random forest (RF), alternative decision tree (ADTree) and Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Function (FLDA). The results of the FLDA, RF and ADTree models were compared with regard to their applicability for creating an LSM of the Gallicash river watershed in the northern part of Iran close to the Caspian Sea. A landslide inventory map was created using GPS points obtained in a field analysis, high-resolution satellite images, topographic maps and historical records. A total of 249 landslide sites have been identified to date and were used in this study to model and validate the LSMs of the study region. Of the 249 landslide locations, 70% were used as training data and 30% for the validation of the resulting LSMs. Sixteen factors related to topographical, hydrological, soil type, geological and environmental conditions were used and a multi-collinearity test of the landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) was performed. Using the natural break method (NBM) in a geographic information system (GIS), the LSMs generated by the RF, FLDA, and ADTree models were categorized into five classes, namely very low, low, medium, high and very high landslide susceptibility (LS) zones. The very high susceptibility zones cover 15.37% (ADTree), 16.10% (FLDA) and 11.36% (RF) of the total catchment area. The results of the different models (FLDA, RF, and ADTree) were explained and compared using the area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, seed cell area index (SCAI), efficiency and true skill statistic (TSS). The accuracy of models was calculated considering both the training and validation data. The results revealed that the AUROC success rates are 0.89 (ADTree), 0.92 (FLDA) and 0.97 (RF) and predication rates are 0.82 (ADTree), 0.79 (FLDA) and 0.98 (RF), which justifies the approach and indicates a reasonably good landslide prediction. The results of the SCAI, efficiency and TSS methods showed that all models have an excellent modeling capability. In a comparison of the models, the RF model outperforms the boosted regression tree (BRT) and ADTree models. The results of the landslide susceptibility modeling could be useful for land-use planning and decision-makers, for managing and controlling the current and future landslides, as well as for the protection of society and the ecosystem."

Moreover, analyses that are conducted can be strongly biased by the standard models employed by seismologists. In response to both of these challenges, we develop a new unsupervised machine learning framework for detecting and clustering seismic signals in continuous seismic records. Our approach combines a deep scattering network and a Gaussian mixture model to cluster seismic signal segments and detect novel structures. To illustrate the power of the framework, we analyze seismic data acquired during the June 2017 Nuugaatsiaq, Greenland landslide. We demonstrate the blind detection and recovery of the repeating precursory seismicity that was recorded before the main landslide rupture, which suggests that our approach could lead to more informative forecasting of the seismic activity in seismogenic areas."

In the development of the ML models, a total of 11 significant landslide controlling factors were selected. The controlling factors relate to the geomorphology, geology, geo-environment and anthropogenic effects: slope angle, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, flow accumulation, flow direction, distance to rivers, water content, saturation, rainfall and distance to roads. It is observed that slope angle was the most significant controlling factor in the ML analyses. The performance of the three ML models was evaluated quantitatively based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results show that the 'ensemble' GBRT machine learning model yielded the most promising results for the spatial prediction of shallow landslides, with a 95% probability of landslide detection and 87% prediction efficiency."

Almost all the studies published in the literature in recent years belong to one of the following three broad categories: landslide detection and mapping, landslide spatial forecasting in the form of susceptibility mapping, and landslide temporal forecasting. In this paper, we present a brief overview of ML techniques, provide a general summary of the landslide studies conducted, in recent years, in the three above-mentioned categories, and make an attempt to critically evaluate the use of ML methods to model landslide processes. The paper also provides suggestions for future use of these powerful data-driven techniques in landslide studies."

We created a geographic information system database, and our analysis results were used to prepare a landslide inventory map containing 359 landslide events identified from Google Earth, aerial photographs, and other validated sources. A support vector regression (SVR) machine-learning model was used to divide the landslide inventory into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. The landslide susceptibility map was produced using 14 causative factors. We applied the established gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, bat algorithm (BA), and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) to fine-tune the parameters of the SVR model to improve its predictive accuracy. The resultant hybrid models, SVR-GWO, SVR-BA, and SVR-COA, were validated in terms of the area under curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE). The AUC values for the SVR-GWO (0.733), SVR-BA (0.724), and SVR-COA (0.738) models indicate their good prediction rates for landslide susceptibility modeling. SVR-COA had the greatest accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.21687, and SVR-BA had the least accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.23046. The three optimized hybrid models outperformed the SVR model (AUC = 0.704, RMSE = 0.26689), confirming the ability of metaheuristic algorithms to improve model performance."
Spatial landslide susceptibility assessment using machine learning techniques assisted by additional data created with generative adversarial networks,"Husam A. H. Al-Najjar, Biswajeet Pradhan",2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.09.002,https://openalex.org/W3088698272,"In recent years, landslide susceptibility mapping has substantially improved with advances in machine learning. However, there are still challenges remain in landslide mapping due to the availability of limited inventory data. In this paper, a novel method that improves the performance of machine learning techniques is presented. The proposed method creates synthetic inventory data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for improving the prediction of landslides. In this research, landslide inventory data of 156 landslide locations were identified in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, taken from previous projects the authors worked on. Elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, total curvature, lithology, land use and land cover (LULC), distance to the road, distance to the river, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), terrain roughness index (TRI), topographic wetness index (TWI) and vegetation density are geo-environmental factors considered in this study based on suggestions from previous works on Cameron Highlands. To show the capability of GANs in improving landslide prediction models, this study tests the proposed GAN model with benchmark models namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Bagging ensemble models with ANN and SVM models. These models were validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The DT, RF, SVM, ANN and Bagging ensemble could achieve the AUROC values of (0.90, 0.94, 0.86, 0.69 and 0.82) for the training; and the AUROC of (0.76, 0.81, 0.85, 0.72 and 0.75) for the test, subsequently. When using additional samples, the same models achieved the AUROC values of (0.92, 0.94, 0.88, 0.75 and 0.84) for the training and (0.78, 0.82, 0.82, 0.78 and 0.80) for the test, respectively. Using the additional samples improved the test accuracy of all the models except SVM. As a result, in data-scarce environments, this research showed that utilizing GANs to generate supplementary samples is promising because it can improve the predictive capability of common landslide prediction models."
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: Machine and Ensemble Learning Based on Remote Sensing Big Data,"Bahareh Kalantar, Naonori Ueda, Vahideh Saeidi, Kourosh Ahmadi, Alfian Abdul Halin, Farzin Shabani",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12111737,https://openalex.org/W3030992380,"Predicting landslide occurrences can be difficult. However, failure to do so can be catastrophic, causing unwanted tragedies such as property damage, community displacement, and human casualties. Research into landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) attempts to alleviate such catastrophes through the identification of landslide prone areas. Computational modelling techniques have been successful in related disaster scenarios, which motivate this work to explore such modelling for LSM. In this research, the potential of supervised machine learning and ensemble learning is investigated. Firstly, the Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA) supervised learning algorithm is trained for LSM and compared against other algorithms that have been widely used for the same purpose, namely Generalized Logistic Models (GLM), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT or GBM), and Random Forest (RF). Next, an ensemble model consisting of all four algorithms is implemented to examine possible performance improvements. The dataset used to train and test all the algorithms consists of a landslide inventory map of 227 landslide locations. From these sources, 13 conditioning factors are extracted to be used in the models. Experimental evaluations are made based on True Skill Statistic (TSS), the Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve and kappa index. The results show that the best TSS (0.6986), ROC (0.904) and kappa (0.6915) were obtained by the ensemble model. FDA on its own seems effective at modelling landslide susceptibility from multiple data sources, with performance comparable to GLM. However, it slightly underperforms when compared to GBM (BRT) and RF. RF seems most capable compared to GBM, GLM, and FDA, when dealing with all conditioning factors."

Therefore, landslide management is essential to maintain the natural and socio-economic dynamics of the hilly region. Rorachu river basin is one of the most landslide-prone areas of the Sikkim selected for the present study. The prime goal of the study is to prepare landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) using computer-based advanced machine learning techniques and compare the performance of the models. To properly understand the existing spatial relation with the landslide, twenty factors, including triggering and causative factors, were selected. A deep learning algorithm viz. convolutional neural network model (CNN) and three popular machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest model (RF), artificial neural network model (ANN), and bagging model, were employed to prepare the LSMs. Two separate datasets including training and validation were designed by randomly taken landslide and non-landslide points. A ratio of 70:30 was considered for the selection of both training and validation points. Multicollinearity was assessed by tolerance and variance inflation factor, and the role of individual conditioning factors was estimated using information gain ratio. The result reveals that there is no severe multicollinearity among the landslide conditioning factors, and the triggering factor rainfall appeared as the leading cause of the landslide. Based on the final prediction values of each model, LSM was constructed and successfully portioned into five distinct classes, like very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The susceptibility class-wise distribution of landslides shows that more than 90% of the landslide area falls under higher landslide susceptibility grades. The precision of models was examined using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and statistical methods like root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). In both datasets (training and validation), the CNN model achieved the maximum AUC value of 0.903 and 0.939, respectively. The lowest value of RMSE and MAE also reveals the better performance of the CNN model. So, it can be concluded that all the models have performed well, but the CNN model has outperformed the other models in terms of precision."
Landslide mapping using object-based image analysis and open source tools,"Pukar Amatya, Dalia Kirschbaum, Thomas Stanley, Hakan Tanyaș",2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2021.106000,https://openalex.org/W3120526585,"Availability of high-resolution optical imagery and advances in image processing technologies have significantly improved our ability to map landslides. In recent years object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been gaining in popularity for landslide mapping due to its ability to incorporate spectral, textural, morphological and topographical properties. Many studies have been conducted based on commercial software. In this study, we create an open source Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system utilizing OBIA and machine learning. Configured to run in Linux environment, it uses various open source Python packages and modules. This system was tested in 575 km2 area along the Pasang Lhamu Highway, Nepal where large numbers of landslides were triggered by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Comparison with a manual inventory highlighted that this system was able to detect 70% of the landslide area. The speed and efficiency with which this system was able to detect landslides makes it a viable alternative to manual techniques for landslide mapping over large areas, when establishing approximate landslide locations is of prime importance."
Landslide detection in the Himalayas using machine learning algorithms and U-Net,"Sansar Raj Meena, Lucas Pedrosa Soares, Carlos Henrique Grohmann, C.J. van Westen, Kushanav Bhuyan, R. P. Singh, Mario Floris, Filippo Catani",2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-022-01861-3,https://openalex.org/W4213060692,"Abstract Event-based landslide inventories are essential sources to broaden our understanding of the causal relationship between triggering events and the occurring landslides. Moreover, detailed inventories are crucial for the succeeding phases of landslide risk studies like susceptibility and hazard assessment. The openly available inventories differ in the quality and completeness levels. Event-based landslide inventories are created based on manual interpretation, and there can be significant differences in the mapping preferences among interpreters. To address this issue, we used two different datasets to analyze the potential of U-Net and machine learning approaches for automated landslide detection in the Himalayas. Dataset-1 is composed of five optical bands from the RapidEye satellite imagery. Dataset-2 is composed of the RapidEye optical data, and ALOS-PALSAR derived topographical data. We used a small dataset consisting of 239 samples acquired from several training zones and one testing zone to evaluate our models’ performance using the fully convolutional U-Net model, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor, and the Random Forest (RF). We created thirty-two different maps to evaluate and understand the implications of different sample patch sizes and their effect on the accuracy of landslide detection in the study area. The results were then compared against the manually interpreted inventory compiled using fieldwork and visual interpretation of the RapidEye satellite image. We used accuracy assessment metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). In the context of the Nepali Himalayas, employing RapidEye images and machine learning models, a viable patch size was investigated. The U-Net model trained with 128 × 128 pixel patch size yields the best MCC results (76.59%) with the dataset-1. The added information from the digital elevation model benefited the overall detection of landslides. However, it does not improve the model’s overall accuracy but helps differentiate human settlement areas and river sand bars. In this study, the U-Net achieved slightly better results than other machine learning approaches. Although it can depend on architecture of the U-Net model and the complexity of the geographical features in the imagery, the U-Net model is still preliminary in the domain of landslide detection. There is very little literature available related to the use of U-Net for landslide detection. This study is one of the first efforts of using U-Net for landslide detection in the Himalayas. Nevertheless, U-Net has the potential to improve further automated landslide detection in the future for varied topographical and geomorphological scenes."

Can, Sultan Kocaman, Candan Gökçeoğlu",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11114993,https://openalex.org/W3170215261,"The success rate in landslide susceptibility mapping efforts increased with the advancements in machine learning algorithms and the availability of geospatial data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Existing data-driven susceptibility mapping models are not globally applicable due to the high variability of landslide conditioning parameters and the limitations in the availability of up-to-date and accurate data. Among numerous applications, landslide susceptibility maps are essential for site selection and health monitoring of engineering structures, such as dams, for increasing their lifetime and to prevent from disastrous events caused by the damages. In this study, landslide susceptibility mapping performance of XGBoost algorithm was evaluated in a landslide-prone area in the upper basin of Ataturk Dam, which is a prime investment located in the southeast of Turkey. The study area has a size of 2718.7 km2 with an elevation difference of ca. 2000 m and contains 27 lithological units. EU-DEM v1.1 from the Copernicus Programme was used to derive the geomorphological features. High classification accuracy with area under curve value of 0.96 could be obtained from the XGBoost algorithm. According to the results, the main factors controlling the landslides in the study area are the lithology, altitude and topographic wetness index."
"Comparison of Random Forest Model and Frequency Ratio Model for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM) in Yunyang County (Chongqing, China)","Yue Wang, Deliang Sun, Haijia Wen, Hong Zhang, Fengtai Zhang",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124206,https://openalex.org/W3035067366,"To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR) model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters; especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments."
Landslide susceptibility prediction using slope unit-based machine learning models considering the heterogeneity of conditioning factors,"Zhilu Chang, Filippo Catani, Faming Huang, Gengzhe Liu, Sansar Raj Meena, Jinsong Huang, Chuangbing Zhou",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrmge.2022.07.009,https://openalex.org/W4293246595,"To perform landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP), it is important to select appropriate mapping unit and landslide-related conditioning factors. The efficient and automatic multi-scale segmentation (MSS) method proposed by the authors promotes the application of slope units. However, LSP modeling based on these slope units has not been performed. Moreover, the heterogeneity of conditioning factors in slope units is neglected, leading to incomplete input variables of LSP modeling. In this study, the slope units extracted by the MSS method are used to construct LSP modeling, and the heterogeneity of conditioning factors is represented by the internal variations of conditioning factors within slope unit using the descriptive statistics features of mean, standard deviation and range. Thus, slope units-based machine learning models considering internal variations of conditioning factors (variant slope-machine learning) are proposed. The Chongyi County is selected as the case study and is divided into 53,055 slope units. Fifteen original slope unit-based conditioning factors are expanded to 38 slope unit-based conditioning factors through considering their internal variations. Random forest (RF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) machine learning models are used to construct variant Slope-RF and Slope-MLP models. Meanwhile, the Slope-RF and Slope-MLP models without considering the internal variations of conditioning factors, and conventional grid units-based machine learning (Grid-RF and MLP) models are built for comparisons through the LSP performance assessments. Results show that the variant Slope-machine learning models have higher LSP performances than Slope-machine learning models; LSP results of variant Slope-machine learning models have stronger directivity and practical application than Grid-machine learning models. It is concluded that slope units extracted by MSS method can be appropriate for LSP modeling, and the heterogeneity of conditioning factors within slope units can more comprehensively reflect the relationships between conditioning factors and landslides. The research results have important reference significance for land use and landslide prevention."

Modeling and validation were done on 111 shallow landslide locations using 20 conditioning factors tested by the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) technique. We assessed model performance with statistically based indexes, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). All four machine learning models that we tested yielded excellent goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, but the RF-RAF ensemble model (AUC = 0.936) outperformed the BA-RAF, RS-RAF (AUC = 0.907), and RAF (AUC = 0.812) models. The results also show that the Random Forest model significantly improved the predictive capability of the RAF-based classifier and, therefore, can be considered as a useful and an effective tool in regional shallow landslide susceptibility mapping."
Improving Spatial Agreement in Machine Learning-Based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping,"Mohammed Sarfaraz Gani Adnan, Md Salman Rahman, Nahian Ahmed, Bayes Ahmed, Md. Fazleh Rabbi, Rashedur M. Rahman",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12203347,https://openalex.org/W3107988978,"Despite yielding considerable degrees of accuracy in landslide predictions, the outcomes of different landslide susceptibility models are prone to spatial disagreement; and therefore, uncertainties. Uncertainties in the results of various landslide susceptibility models create challenges in selecting the most suitable method to manage this complex natural phenomenon. This study aimed to propose an approach to reduce uncertainties in landslide prediction, diagnosing spatial agreement in machine learning-based landslide susceptibility maps. It first developed landslide susceptibility maps of Cox’s Bazar district of Bangladesh, applying four machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), featuring hyperparameter optimization of 12 landslide conditioning factors. The results of all the four models yielded very high prediction accuracy, with the area under the curve (AUC) values range between 0.93 to 0.96. The assessment of spatial agreement of landslide predictions showed that the pixel-wise correlation coefficients of landslide probability between various models range from 0.69 to 0.85, indicating the uncertainty in predicted landslides by various models, despite their considerable prediction accuracy. The uncertainty was addressed by establishing a Logistic Regression (LR) model, incorporating the binary landslide inventory data as the dependent variable and the results of the four landslide susceptibility models as independent variables. The outcomes indicated that the RF model had the highest influence in predicting the observed landslide locations, followed by the MLP, SVM, and KNN models. Finally, a combined landslide susceptibility map was developed by integrating the results of the four machine learning-based landslide predictions. The combined map resulted in better spatial agreement (correlation coefficients range between 0.88 and 0.92) and greater prediction accuracy (0.97) compared to the individual models. The modelling approach followed in this study would be useful in minimizing uncertainties of various methods and improving landslide predictions."
Comparative analysis of gradient boosting algorithms for landslide susceptibility mapping,Emrehan Kutluğ Şahin,2020,https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.1831623,https://openalex.org/W3092049673,"The aim of the study is to compare four recent gradient boosting algorithms named as Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) for modelling landslide susceptibility (LS). In the first step of the study, the geodatabase including landslide inventory map and landslide conditioning factors was constructed. In the second step, chi-square (CHI) statistic-based feature selection (FS) technique was utilized to compute the importance of the landslide causative factors. In the third step, tree-based ensemble learning algorithms were applied to predict the potential distribution of landslide susceptibility. Also, the prediction performance of ensemble methods was compared to that of Random Forest (RF) ensemble method. Finally, the prediction capabilities of the methods were assessed using overall accuracy (Acc), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), kappa index, root mean square error (RMSE), and F score measures. In order to further evaluation, the McNemar's test was utilized to assess statistical significance in the differences between the four gradient boosting models. The accuracy results indicated that the CatBoost model had the highest prediction capability (Acc= 0.8503 and AUC= 0.8975), followed by the XGBoost (Acc= 0.8336 and AUC= 0.8860), the LightGBM (Acc= 0.8244 and AUC= 0.8796) and the GBM (Acc= 0.8080 and AUC= 0.8685). On the other hand, the estimated accuracy measures considered in this study showed that the RF method had the lowest prediction capability of compared the others. Although the individual performances of the methods were found to be acceptable level, the CatBoost method showed the superior performance compared to others with respect to the AUC and Acc values estimated in this study. The results of the study confirmed that the relatively new ensemble learning techniques were efficient and robust for producing LS maps and furthermore, it is probably that these algorithms will be preferred more often in the future studies due to their robustness."

The analysis revealed that RFC was the most accurate model (overall accuracy of 98.3% and AUC of 97.0%). Besides, the heuristic approach of FDEMATEL-ANP model (overall accuracy of 93.8% and AUC of 92.4%) had better prediction capability than bivariate FR (overall accuracy of 86.9% and AUC of 86.1%), multivariate LR (overall accuracy of 90.5% and AUC of 91.2%), machine learning NBC (overall accuracy of 76.3% and AUC of 90.9%) and even deep learning XGBoost (overall accuracy of 92.3% and AUC of 87.1%) models. The study revealed that the FDEMATEL-ANP outweighed the NBC and XGBoost machine learning models, which suggests that heuristic methods should be tested out before directly applying machine learning models."

The study area is in southwestern Iran. The region has experienced numerous extreme natural events in recent decades. This study models the probabilities of snow avalanches, landslides, wildfires, land subsidence, and floods using machine learning models that include support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and generalized linear model (GLM). Climatic, topographic, geological, social, and morphological factors were the main input variables used. The data were obtained from several sources. The accuracies of GLM, SVM, and functional discriminant analysis (FDA) models indicate that SVM is the most accurate for predicting landslides, land subsidence, and flood hazards in the study area. GLM is the best algorithm for wildfire mapping, and FDA is the most accurate model for predicting snow avalanche risk. The values of AUC (area under curve) for all five hazards using the best models are greater than 0.8, demonstrating that the model’s predictive abilities are acceptable. A machine learning approach can prove to be very useful tool for hazard management and disaster mitigation, particularly for multi-hazard modeling. The predictive maps produce valuable baselines for risk management in the study area, providing evidence to manage future human interaction with hazards."

Reducing the outputs obtained after each modelling analysis is key to present the results for stakeholders, land managers and policymakers. So, the main goal of this survey was to present a method to synthesize three natural hazards in one multi-hazard map and its evaluation for hazard management and land use planning. To test this methodology, we took as study area the Gorganrood Watershed, located in the Golestan Province (Iran). First, an inventory map of three different types of hazards including flood, landslides, and gullies was prepared using field surveys and different official reports. To generate the susceptibility maps, a total of 17 geo-environmental factors were selected as predictors using the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) machine learning technique. The accuracy of the predictive models was evaluated by drawing receiver operating characteristic-ROC curves and calculating the area under the ROC curve-AUCROC. The MaxEnt model not only implemented superbly in the degree of fitting, but also obtained significant results in predictive performance. Variables importance of the three studied types of hazards showed that river density, distance from streams, and elevation were the most important factors for flood, respectively. Lithological units, elevation, and annual mean rainfall were relevant for detecting landslides. On the other hand, annual mean rainfall, elevation, and lithological units were used for gully erosion mapping in this study area. Finally, by combining the flood, landslides, and gully erosion susceptibility maps, an integrated multi-hazard map was created. The results demonstrated that 60% of the area is subjected to hazards, reaching a proportion of landslides up to 21.2% in the whole territory. We conclude that using this type of multi-hazard map may be a useful tool for local administrators to identify areas susceptible to hazards at large scales as we demonstrated in this research."

Originally, most of those maps were generated by the judgements of experts, which is time‐consuming and laborious, and whose accuracy is difficult to be quantified because of the subjective effects. With the development of machine learning algorithms and the methods of data collection, big data and artificial intelligence have now been popularized in this field, significantly improving mapping accuracy and efficiency. Various machine learning‐based methods, mainly including conventional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning have been applied and compared in LSM in different areas by previous researchers. Nevertheless, none of them can be effective in all cases. Although deep learning‐based methods were proven more accurate than conventional machine learning‐based methods in most data‐rich situations, the latter is sometimes more popularly used in LSM, as there is not that much data in this field to train a deep learning network perfectly. In a more rigorous situation when there is very limited data, transfer learning‐based approaches are applied by several researchers, which have contributed to improve the workability and the accuracy of LSM in data‐limited areas. Such technical explosion has promoted the application of landslide susceptibility maps, thus contributing to mitigating the social‐eco impact associated with landslides. This paper comprehensively reviews the whole process of generating landslide susceptibility maps based on machine learning methods, introduces and compares the commonly used machine learning methods, and discusses the topics for future research."
An interpretable model for the susceptibility of rainfall-induced shallow landslides based on SHAP and XGBoost,"Xinzhi Zhou, Haijia Wen, Ziwei Li, Hui Zhang, Wengang Zhang",2022,https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2076928,https://openalex.org/W4280525102,"The machine-learning ""black box"" models, which lack interpretability, have limited application in landslide susceptibility mapping.

In this study, a novel interpretable model based on SHAP and XGBoost is proposed to interpret landslides susceptibility evaluation at global and local levels. The established evaluation model provided 0.75 accuracy and 0.83 AUC value for the test sets. The global interpretation shows that the peak rainfall intensity and elevation are the dominant factors that influence the occurrence of landslides in the study area. The combination of local interpretation and field investigations can provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating designated landslides, and it can also be used as a reference for preventing and managing the hazards of landslides."

This paper explores the predictive capacity of different approaches to LS modelling using artificial intelligence. The key objective of this study is to estimate a LS map for the Taleghan-Alamut basin of Iran using Credal Decision Tree (CDT)-based (i.e. CDT-Bagging, CDT-Multiboost and CDT-SubSpace) hybrid machine learning approaches, which are state-of-the-art soft computing approaches that are hardly ever utilized in the assessment of LS. In this study, we used eighteen landslide predisposing factors (LPFs) that we considered to be the most important local morphological and geo-environmental factors influencing the occurrence of landslides. We calculated the significance of each of the LPFs in the landslide susceptibility assessment using the Random Forest Method. We also employed the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, precision, performance, map robustness measurement and selection of the best-fitting models. The results shows that, compared to the other models, the CDT-Multiboost is the excellent model in this perspective with an average area under curve (AUC) of 0.993 based on a 4-fold cross-validation. We, therefore, consider the CDT-Multiboost models to be an effective method for improving spatial prediction of LS where landslide scarps or bodies are not clearly identified during the preparation of landslide inventory maps. Therefore, it will be helpful for preparing future landslide inventory maps and mitigate landslide damages."
A new strategy to map landslides with a generalized convolutional neural network,"Nikhil Prakash, Andrea Manconi, Simon Loew",2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89015-8,https://openalex.org/W3158723639,"Abstract Rapid mapping of event landslides is crucial to identify the areas affected by damages as well as for effective disaster response. Traditionally, such maps are generated with visual interpretation of remote sensing imagery (manned/unmanned airborne systems or spaceborne sensors) and/or using pixel-based and object-based methods exploiting data-intensive machine learning algorithms. Recent works have explored the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning algorithm, for mapping landslides from remote sensing data. These methods follow a standard supervised learning workflow that involves training a model using a landslide inventory covering a relatively small area. The trained model is then used to predict landslides in the surrounding regions. Here, we propose a new strategy, i.e., a progressive CNN training relying on combined inventories to build a generalized model that can be applied directly to a new, unexplored area. We first prove the effectiveness of CNNs by training and validating on event landslides inventories in four regions after earthquakes and/or extreme meteorological events. Next, we use the trained CNNs to map landslides triggered by new events spread across different geographic regions. We found that CNNs trained on a combination of inventories have a better generalization performance, with a bias towards high precision and low recall scores. In our tests, the combined training model achieved the highest (Matthews correlation coefficient) MCC score of 0.69 when mapping landslides in new unseen regions. The mapping was done on images from different optical sensors, resampled to a spatial resolution of 6 m, 10 m, and 30 m. Despite a slightly reduced performance, the main advantage of combined training is to overcome the requirement of a local inventory for training a new deep learning model. This implementation can facilitate automated pipelines providing fast response for the generation of landslide maps in the post-disaster phase. In this study, the study areas were selected from seismically active zones with a high hydrological hazard distribution and vegetation coverage. Hence, future works should also include regions from less vegetated geographic locations."
Data-Driven Landslide Nowcasting at the Global Scale,"Thomas Stanley, Dalia Kirschbaum, Garrett Benz, Robert Emberson, Pukar Amatya, William Medwedeff, Marin K. Clark",2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.640043,https://openalex.org/W3164108078,"Landslides affect nearly every country in the world each year. To better understand this global hazard, the Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model was developed previously. LHASA version 1 combines satellite precipitation estimates with a global landslide susceptibility map to produce a gridded map of potentially hazardous areas from 60° North-South every 3 h. LHASA version 1 categorizes the world’s land surface into three ratings: high, moderate, and low hazard with a single decision tree that first determines if the last seven days of rainfall were intense, then evaluates landslide susceptibility. LHASA version 2 has been developed with a data-driven approach. The global susceptibility map was replaced with a collection of explanatory variables, and two new dynamically varying quantities were added: snow and soil moisture. Along with antecedent rainfall, these variables modulated the response to current daily rainfall. In addition, the Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was supplemented with several inventories of rainfall-triggered landslide events. These factors were incorporated into the machine-learning framework XGBoost, which was trained to predict the presence or absence of landslides over the period 2015–2018, with the years 2019–2020 reserved for model evaluation. As a result of these improvements, the new global landslide nowcast was twice as likely to predict the occurrence of historical landslides as LHASA version 1, given the same global false positive rate. Furthermore, the shift to probabilistic outputs allows users to directly manage the trade-off between false negatives and false positives, which should make the nowcast useful for a greater variety of geographic settings and applications. In a retrospective analysis, the trained model ran over a global domain for 5 years, and results for LHASA version 1 and version 2 were compared. Due to the importance of rainfall and faults in LHASA version 2, nowcasts would be issued more frequently in some tropical countries, such as Colombia and Papua New Guinea; at the same time, the new version placed less emphasis on arid regions and areas far from the Pacific Rim. LHASA version 2 provides a nearly real-time view of global landslide hazard for a variety of stakeholders."
Landslide4Sense: Reference Benchmark Data and Deep Learning Models for Landslide Detection,"Omid Ghorbanzadeh, Yonghao Xu, Pedram Ghamisi, Michael Kopp, David P.

The repository features 3,799 image patches fusing optical layers from Sentinel-2 sensors with the digital elevation model and slope layer derived from ALOS PALSAR. The added topographical information facilitates an accurate detection of landslide borders, which recent researches have shown to be challenging using optical data alone. The extensive data set supports deep learning (DL) studies in landslide detection and the development and validation of methods for the systematic update of landslide inventories. The benchmark data set has been collected at four different times and geographical locations: Iburi (September 2018), Kodagu (August 2018), Gorkha (April 2015), and Taiwan (August 2009). Each image pixel is labelled as belonging to a landslide or not, incorporating various sources and thorough manual annotation. We then evaluate the landslide detection performance of 11 state-of-the-art DL segmentation models: U-Net, ResU-Net, PSPNet, ContextNet, DeepLab-v2, DeepLab-v3+, FCN-8s, LinkNet, FRRN-A, FRRN-B, and SQNet. All models were trained from scratch on patches from one quarter of each study area and tested on independent patches from the other three quarters. Our experiments demonstrate that ResU-Net outperformed the other models for the landslide detection task. We make the multi-source landslide benchmark data (Landslide4Sense) and the tested DL models publicly available at https://www.iarai.ac.at/landslide4sense, establishing an important resource for remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning communities in studies of image classification in general and applications to landslide detection in particular."
Landslide Susceptibility Prediction Modeling Based on Remote Sensing and a Novel Deep Learning Algorithm of a Cascade-Parallel Recurrent Neural Network,"Li Zhu, Liang-Hao Huang, Linyu Fan, Jinsong Huang, Faming Huang, Jiawu Chen, Zihe Zhang, Yuhao Wang",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20061576,https://openalex.org/W3010924259,"Landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) modeling is an important and challenging problem. Landslide features are generally uncorrelated or nonlinearly correlated, resulting in limited LSP performance when leveraging conventional machine learning models. In this study, a deep-learning-based model using the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and conditional random field (CRF) in cascade-parallel form was proposed for making LSPs based on remote sensing (RS) images and a geographic information system (GIS). The RS images are the main data sources of landslide-related environmental factors, and a GIS is used to analyze, store, and display spatial big data. The cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF consists of frequency ratio values of environmental factors in the input layers, cascade-parallel LSTM for feature extraction in the hidden layers, and cascade-parallel full connection for classification and CRF for landslide/non-landslide state modeling in the output layers. The cascade-parallel form of LSTM can extract features from different layers and merge them into concrete features. The CRF is used to calculate the energy relationship between two grid points, and the extracted features are further smoothed and optimized. As a case study, the cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF was applied to Shicheng County of Jiangxi Province in China. A total of 2709 landslide grid cells were recorded and 2709 non-landslide grid cells were randomly selected from the study area. The results show that, compared with existing main traditional machine learning algorithms, such as multilayer perception, logistic regression, and decision tree, the proposed cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF had a higher landslide prediction rate (positive predictive rate: 72.44%, negative predictive rate: 80%, total predictive rate: 75.67%). In conclusion, the proposed cascade-parallel LSTM-CRF is a novel data-driven deep learning model that overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning algorithms and achieves promising results for making LSPs."

It is likely to occur more frequently due to increasing urbanization, deforestation, and climate change. Landslide susceptibility mapping is vital to safeguard life and property. This article surveys machine learning (ML) models used for landslide susceptibility mapping to understand the current trend by analyzing published articles based on the ML models, landslide causative factors (LCFs), study location, datasets, evaluation methods, and model performance. Existing literature considered in this comprehensive survey is systematically selected using the ROSES protocol. The trend indicates a growing interest in the field.

A comprehensive comparison among metaheuristics (MHs) for geohazard modeling using machine learning: Insights from a case study of landslide displacement prediction,"Junwei Ma, Ding Xia, Yankun Wang, Xiaoxu Niu, Sheng Jiang, Zhiyang Liu, Haixiang Guo",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105150,https://openalex.org/W4284671606,"Machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to model geohazards, yielding tremendous success. However, researchers and practitioners still face challenges in enhancing the reliability of ML models. In the present study, a systematic framework combining k-fold cross-validation (CV), metaheuristics (MHs), support vector regression (SVR), and Friedman and Nemenyi tests was proposed to improve the reliability and performance of geohazard modeling. The average normalized mean square error (NMSE) from k-fold CV sets was adopted as the fitness metric. Twenty of the most well-established MHs and the most recent MHs were adopted to tune the hyperparameters of SVR and were evaluated through nonparametric Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests to identify significant differences. Observations from a typical reservoir landslide were selected as a benchmark dataset, and the accuracy, robustness, computational time, and convergence speed of the MHs were compared. Significant performance differences among the twenty MHs were identified by Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests of the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), and computational time, with p values lower than 0.05. The comparison of results demonstrated that the multiverse optimizer (MVO) is among the highest-performing, most stable, and computationally efficient algorithms, providing superior performance to other methods, with nearly optimum values of the correlation coefficient (R), a low MAE (23.5086 versus 23.9360), a low mean RMSE (48.6946 versus 50.1882), and a high mean KGE (0.9803 versus 0.9893) in predicting the displacement of the Shuping landslide. This paper considerably enriches the literature regarding hyperparameter optimization algorithms and the enhancement of their reliability. In addition, Friedman and post hoc Nemenyi tests have the potential for evaluating and comparing various ML-based geohazard models."
Landslide detection by deep learning of non-nadiral and crowdsourced optical images,Filippo Catani,2020,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-020-01513-4,https://openalex.org/W3082129780,"Abstract The recent development of mobile surveying platforms and crowdsourced geoinformation has produced a huge amount of non-validated data that are now available for research and application. In the field of risk analysis, with particular reference to landslide hazard, images generated by autonomous platforms (such as UAVs, ground-based acquisition systems, satellite sensors) and pictures obtained from web data mining are easily gathered and contribute to the fast surge in the amount of non-organized information that may engulf data storage facilities. Therefore, the high potential impact of such methods is severely reduced by the need of a massive amount of human intelligence tasks (HITs), which is necessary to filter and classify the data, whatever the final purpose. In this work, we present a new set of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) specifically designed for the automated recognition of landslides and mass movements in non-standard pictures that can be used in automated image classification, in supporting UAV autonomous guidance and in the filtering of data-mined information. Computer vision can be of great help in fostering the autonomous capability of intelligent systems to complement, or completely substitute, HITs. Image and object recognition are at the forefront of this research field. The deep learning procedure has been accomplished by applying transfer learning to some of the top-performer CNNs available in the literature. Results show that the deep learning machines, calibrated on a relevant dataset of validated images of landforms, may supply reliable predictions with computational time and resource requirements compatible with most of the UAV platforms and web data mining applications in landslide hazard studies. Average accuracy achieved by the proposed methods ranges between 87 and 90% and is consistently higher than that obtained by general-purpose state-of-the-art image recognition convolutional neural networks. The method can be applied to early warning, vulnerability assessment, residual risk estimation, model parameterisation and landslide mapping. Specific advantages will be the reduction of the present limitations in the intelligent guidance of landslide mapping drones, the classification of fake news, the validation of post-disaster information and the correct interpretation of an impending change in the environment."

Data of 167 past and present landslides and various landslide conditioning factors were used for generation of the datasets. The results showed that the RSSFT model achieved the highest performance in terms of Fgiurepredicting future landslides, followed by RSSREPT, RSSBFT, RSSJ48, and RSSNBT, respectively. Therefore, the RSSFT model was found to be more robust model than the other studied models, which can be used in other areas of landslide susceptibility mapping for proper landuse planning and management."
Monitoring Forest Change in the Amazon Using Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Classification on Google Earth Engine,"Maria Antonia Brovelli, Yaru Sun, Vasil Yordanov",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9100580,https://openalex.org/W3090330565,"Deforestation causes diverse and profound consequences for the environment and species. Direct or indirect effects can be related to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, floods, landslides, etc. As such a significant process, timely and continuous monitoring of forest dynamics is important, to constantly follow existing policies and develop new mitigation measures. The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the Pará state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of high-resolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000–2006; for the period 2006–2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019–2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies."

The choice of conditional factors is crucial to the results of LSM, and the selection of models also plays an important role. In this study, a hybrid method including GeoDetector and machine learning cluster was developed to provide a new perspective on how to address these two issues. We defined redundant factors by quantitatively analyzing the single impact and interactive impact of the factors, which was analyzed by GeoDetector, the effect of this step was examined using mean absolute error (MAE). The machine learning cluster contains four models (artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian network (BN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM)) and automatically selects the best one for generating LSM. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, prediction accuracy, and the seed cell area index (SCAI) methods were used to evaluate these methods. The results show that the SVM model had the best performance in the machine learning cluster with the area under the ROC curve of 0.928 and with an accuracy of 83.86%. Therefore, SVM was chosen as the assessment model to map the landslide susceptibility of the study area. The landslide susceptibility map demonstrated fit with landslide inventory, indicated the hybrid method is effective in screening landslide influences and assessing landslide susceptibility."
Multi-hazard susceptibility and exposure assessment of the Hindu Kush Himalaya,"Jack Rusk, Amina Maharjan, Prakash C. Tiwari, Tzu‐Hsin Karen Chen, Sara Shneiderman, Mark Turin, Karen C. Seto",2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150039,https://openalex.org/W3196556441,"Mountainous regions are highly hazardous, and these hazards often lead to loss of human life. The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH."
Metaheuristic-based support vector regression for landslide displacement prediction: a comparative study,"Junwei Ma, Ding Xia, Haixiang Guo, Yankun Wang, Xiaoxu Niu, Zhiyang Liu, Sheng Jiang",2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-022-01923-6,https://openalex.org/W4283750094,"Abstract Recently, integrated machine learning (ML) metaheuristic algorithms, such as the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and water cycle algorithm (WCA), have become predominant approaches for landslide displacement prediction. However, these algorithms suffer from poor reproducibility across replicate cases. In this study, a hybrid approach integrating k-fold cross validation (CV), metaheuristic support vector regression (SVR), and the nonparametric Friedman test is proposed to enhance reproducibility. The five previously mentioned metaheuristics were compared in terms of accuracy, computational time, robustness, and convergence. The results obtained for the Shuping and Baishuihe landslides demonstrate that the hybrid approach can be utilized to determine the optimum hyperparameters and present statistical significance, thus enhancing accuracy and reliability in ML-based prediction. Significant differences were observed among the five metaheuristics. Based on the Friedman test, which was performed on the root mean square error (RMSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and computational time, PSO is recommended for hyperparameter tuning for SVR-based displacement prediction due to its ability to maintain a balance between precision, computational time, and robustness. The nonparametric Friedman test is promising for presenting statistical significance, thus enhancing reproducibility."
Prediction of landslide displacement with dynamic features using intelligent approaches,"Yonggang Zhang, Jun Tang, Yung‐Ming Cheng, Lei Huang, Fei Guo, Xiangjie Yin, Na Li",2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmst.2022.02.004,https://openalex.org/W4213192855,"Landslide displacement prediction can enhance the efficacy of landslide monitoring system, and the prediction of the periodic displacement is particularly challenging. In the previous studies, static regression models (e.g., support vector machine (SVM)) were mostly used for predicting the periodic displacement. These models may have bad performances, when the dynamic features of landslide triggers are incorporated. This paper proposes a method for predicting the landslide displacement in a dynamic manner, based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network and complete ensemble empirical decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). The CEEMDAN is used to decompose the training data, and the GRU is subsequently used for predicting the periodic displacement. Implementation procedures of the proposed method were illustrated by a case study in the Caojiatuo landslide area, and SVM was also adopted for the periodic displacement prediction. This case study shows that the predictors obtained by SVM are inaccurate, as the landslide displacement is in a pronouncedly step-wise manner. By contrast, the accuracy can be significantly improved using the dynamic predictive method. This paper reveals the significance of capturing the dynamic features of the inputs in the training process, when the machine learning models are adopted to predict the landslide displacement."
Combining Evolutionary Algorithms and Machine Learning Models in Landslide Susceptibility Assessments,"Wei Chen, Yunzhi Chen, Paraskevas Tsangaratos, Ioanna Ilia, Xiaojing Wang",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12233854,https://openalex.org/W3109171118,"The main objective of the present study is to introduce a novel predictive model that combines evolutionary algorithms and machine learning (ML) models, so as to construct a landslide susceptibility map. Genetic algorithms (GA) are used as a feature selection method, whereas the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used to optimize the structural parameters of two ML models, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). A well-defined spatial database, which included 335 landslides and twelve landslide-related variables (elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, distance to faults, distance to river, lithology, and hydrological cover) are considered for the analysis, in the Achaia Regional Unit located in Northern Peloponnese, Greece. The outcome of the study illustrates that both ML models have an excellent performance, with the SVM model achieving the highest learning accuracy (0.977 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value (AUC)), followed by the ANN model (0.969). However, the ANN model shows the highest prediction accuracy (0.800 AUC), followed by the SVM (0.750 AUC) model. Overall, the proposed ML models highlights the necessity of feature selection and tuning procedures via evolutionary optimization algorithms and that such approaches could be successfully used for landslide susceptibility mapping as an alternative investigation tool."

We located 152 landslides using a combination of interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Google Earth (GE), and field surveys. Of the total slide locations, 80% (122 landslides) were utilized for training the selected algorithms, and the remaining 20% (30 landslides) were applied for validation purposes. We employed 17 conditioning factors, including slope angle, aspect, elevation, curvature, profile curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, soil type, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to river, distance to fault, distance to road, river density, fault density, and road density, which were produced from satellite imageries, geological map, soil maps, and a digital elevation model (DEM). We used these factors to produce landslide susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), and random forest (RF) models. To assess prediction accuracy of the models we employed the following statistical measures: negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Our results indicated that the AUC was 92%, 90%, and 88% for the LMT, LR, and RF algorithms, respectively. To assess model performance, we also applied non-parametric statistical tests of Friedman and Wilcoxon, where the results revealed that there were no practical differences among the used models in the study area. While landslide mapping in tropical environment such as Cameron Highlands remains difficult, the remote sensing (RS) along with machine learning techniques, such as the LMT model, show promise for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area."

Fast and accurate mapping of coseismic landslides is important for earthquake disaster emergency rescue and landslide risk analysis. Machine learning methods provide automatic solutions for landslide detection, which are more efficient than manual landslide mapping. Deep learning technologies are attracting increasing interest in automatic landslide detection. CNN is one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks for landslide detection. However, in practice, the performance of the existing CNN-based landslide detection models is still far from practical application. Recently, Transformer has achieved better performance in many computer vision tasks, which provides a great opportunity for improving the accuracy of landslide detection. To fill this gap, we explore whether Transformer can outperform CNNs in the landslide detection task. Specifically, we build a new dataset for identifying coseismic landslides. The Transformer-based semantic segmentation model SegFormer is employed to identify coseismic landslides. SegFormer leverages Transformer to obtain a large receptive field, which is much larger than CNN. SegFormer introduces overlapped patch embedding to capture the interaction of adjacent image patches. SegFormer also introduces a simple MLP decoder and sequence reduction to improve its efficiency. The semantic segmentation results of SegFormer are further improved by leveraging image processing operations to distinguish different landslide instances and remove invalid holes. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare Transformer-based model SegFormer with other popular CNN-based models, including HRNet, DeepLabV3, Attention-UNet, U2Net and FastSCNN. SegFormer improves the accuracy, mIoU, IoU and F1 score of landslide detectuin by 2.2%, 5% and 3%, respectively. SegFormer also reduces the pixel-wise classification error rate by 14%. Both quantitative evaluation and visualization results show that Transformer is capable of outperforming CNNs in landslide detection."

To construct and verify the hybrid RFM model, a shallow landslide database of the Lang Son area (northern Vietnam) was prepared. The database consisted of 101 shallow landslide polygons and 14 conditioning factors. The relevance of these factors for shallow landslide susceptibility modeling was assessed using the ReliefF method. Experimental results pointed out that the proposed RFM can help to achieve the desired prediction with an F1 score of roughly 0.96. The performance of the RFM was better than those of benchmark approaches, including the SVM, RFC, and logistic regression. Thus, the newly developed RFM is a promising tool to help local authorities in shallow landslide hazard mitigations."
